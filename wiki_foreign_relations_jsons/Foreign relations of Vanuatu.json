"{{short description|none}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2020}}\n{{Politics of Vanuatu}}\n\n[[Vanuatu]] maintains diplomatic relations with many countries, and it has a small network of [[Diplomatic missions of Vanuatu|diplomatic missions]]. [[Australia]], [[France]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], the [[People's Republic of China]], [[South Korea]] and the [[United Kingdom]] maintain embassies, High Commissions, or missions in [[Port Vila]]. The [[British High Commission]] maintained a continued presence for almost a century, though closed from 2005 until reopening in 2019.<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/change-of-british-high-commissioner-to-vanuatu-summer-2019 Change of British High Commissioner to Vanuatu - Summer 2019], GOV.UK. Retrieved 15 February 2020.</ref>\n\nThe government's main concern has been to bolster the economy. In keeping with its need for financial assistance, Vanuatu has joined the [[Asian Development Bank]], the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). According to [[ABC Radio Australia]], \"Foreign policy issues that feature in Vanuatu include wide support for the [[Free Papua Movement|Free West Papua Movement]] and broadly for independence throughout [[Melanesia]], the [[One China Policy]] and relations with Australia and New Zealand.\" On the latter topic, [[guest worker]] programmes feature prominently.<ref>[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200809/s2359773.htm?tab=pacific \"Uncertainty after Vanuatu's general election\"], ABC Radio Australia, 9 September 2008</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===1980s: the Lini policies===\n\nVanuatu (formerly the [[New Hebrides]]) obtained independence from France and the [[United Kingdom]] in 1980. The country's first elected leader, Prime Minister Father [[Walter Lini]], governed Vanuatu from 1980 to 1991, and shaped its initial foreign policy in distinct ways. The key bases of Lini's foreign policy were [[neutrality (international relations)|non-alignment]] and [[anti-colonialism]], support for independence movements around the world - from faraway [[Western Sahara]] to neighbouring [[New Caledonia]], as well as [[East Timor]] and [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]], who all received Vanuatu's support at the [[United Nations]].<ref name=\"HUFFER, Elise 1993, pp. 272–282\">HUFFER, Elise, ''Grands hommes et petites îles: La politique extérieure de Fidji, de Tonga et du Vanuatu'', Paris: Orstom, 1993, {{ISBN|2-7099-1125-6}}, pp. 272–282</ref>\n\nVanuatu notably angered [[Indonesia]] by allowing the [[Free Papua Movement]] to open an office in [[Port-Vila]]. Vanuatu in the 1980s was the only country in Oceania not to align with the [[Western bloc]] in the dying stages of the [[Cold War]]. Rejecting support either for the West or for the [[Eastern bloc|East]], Vanuatu joined the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 1983, and only established diplomatic relations with the [[Soviet Union–Vanuatu relations|Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] in June and September 1986, respectively.<ref name=\"HUFFER, Elise 1993, pp. 272–282\"/>\n\nIn keeping with this policy, Vanuatu established [[Vanuatu–Cuba relations|diplomatic relations with Cuba]] in 1983, and [[Vanuatu–Libya relations|with Libya]] in 1986. Lini openly condemned the [[1986 bombing of Libya]] by the United States, sending a message of condoleances to Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]], while [[Barak Sopé]] accused the United States of being a [[State sponsor of terrorism]]. The same accusation was levelled by Vanuatu against France after the sinking of the ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|Rainbow Warrior]]''. [[United States–Vanuatu relations|Relations with the United States]] were tense until the late 1980s, when a State visit to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] by Lini and Foreign Affairs Minister [[Sela Molisa]] contributed to a lessening of tensions. [[France–Vanuatu relations|Relations with France]] remained strained throughout the 1980s for [[France–Vanuatu relations#1980s: off to a rocky start|a variety of reasons]].<ref>''Ibid''</ref>\n\nLini's government opposed [[French nuclear tests]] at [[Mururoa]], and spoke out repeatedly against [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]]. Vanuatu was a member of the [[United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid]]. In 1990, Vanuatu's ambassador to the United Nations [[Robert Van Lierop]] remarked proudly: \"I think that Vanuatu's contribution to the United Nations is somewhat disproportionate in relation to its size. [...] When the Prime Minister met [[Nelson Mandela]] in [[Namibia]], Mandela knew about Vanuatu because it has always been among the countries in the region that have most clearly spoken out on the problem of apartheid\".<ref>''Ibid''</ref>\n\nVanuatu under Walter Lini also sought to create solid relations with [[Asia]], and, by the end of the decade, had established official diplomatic relations with the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[North Korea]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Vietnam]] and the [[Philippines]].<ref>''Ibid''</ref>\n\n===1990s: the Carlot Korman and Vohor years===\n\nFollowing the [[1991 Vanuatuan general election|1991 general election]], the [[French language|francophone]] [[Union of Moderate Parties]] became the dominant party in Parliament, and [[Maxime Carlot Korman]] became the country's first francophone Prime Minister. He \"reversed [the country's] unequivocal support for the [[Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front|Kanak National Liberation Front]] in New Caledonia, its systematic enmity towards France, its flirting with radical regimes, and its openly anti-American nuclear-free Pacific stance.\" Francophones held power, under Carlot Korman or [[Serge Vohor]], until 1998.<ref>William F.S. Miles, ''Bridging Mental Boundaries in a Postcolonial Microcosm: Identity and Development in Vanuatu'', Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8248-2048-7}}, pp. 25–7</ref>\n\n== Foreign policy issues ==\n\n=== Aid ===\n\nSince 1980, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and New Zealand have provided the bulk of Vanuatu's development aid. As of March 2008, Australia was Vanuatu's biggest aid provider, followed by France.<ref>[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/pays-zones-geo_833/vanuatu_580/france-vanuatu_3395/index.html \"La France et le Vanuatu\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309153010/http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/pays-zones-geo_833/vanuatu_580/france-vanuatu_3395/index.html |date=9 March 2012 }}, French Ministry of Foreign Affairs</ref> A number of other countries, including [[Japan]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], and various multilateral organizations, such as the [[Economic and Social Council for Asia and the Pacific]], the [[UN Development Programme]], the Asian Development Bank, the [[European Economic Community]], and the [[Commonwealth Development Corporation]] also provide developmental aid. The [[United States]], Canada, [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]], South Korea and Japan also send volunteers. Since the mid-2000s, Cuba has been a noted provider of medical aid.\n\n===Support to the right of self-determination===\n\nVanuatu continues to promote the right to [[self-determination]]. In the 1980s, the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic|SADR]] and [[Palestine]] was recognized.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} Later, Vanuatu recognized [[Kosovo]] in 2010 and [[Abkhazia]] in 2011.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} Vanuatu is the only country in the world that recognizes all four of these states.{{Time needed|date=April 2021}} This makes Vanuatu the only country in Oceania to officially recognize each of Palestine, the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and Abkhazia as of August 2025. In addition, Vanuatu strongly supports the [[Free Papua Movement]] and its program of self-determination of [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]], a region in [[Indonesia]], in the midst of [[Papua conflict]]. Vanuatu's bringing up the issue at international forums has brought sharp rebukes from Indonesia; according to its diplomats, \"it is shameful that [Vanuatu has an] excessive and unhealthy obsession about how Indonesia should govern itself\" and states that Vanuatu is \"not a representation of the people of Papua, and stop fantasising of being one.\"<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/427114/indonesia-lashes-out-at-vanuatu-over-west-papua-at-the-un| title = Indonesia lashes out at Vanuatu over West Papua at the UN| website = [[Radio New Zealand]]| date = 28 September 2020}}</ref>\n\n====''Wantok Blong Yumi Bill''====\n\nIn June 2010, the [[Parliament of Vanuatu]] unanimously gave its support to a motion – the [[Wantok Blong Yumi Bill]] – clarifying Vanuatu's foreign policy with regards to West Papuan independence claims from Indonesia. The bill, tabled by Independent MP [[Ralph Regenvanu]] and supported by Prime Minister [[Edward Natapei]] and opposition leader [[Maxime Carlot Korman]], committed Vanuatu to recognising West Papua's independence; to seeking observer status for West Papua in the [[Melanesian Spearhead Group]] and in the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]; and to \"request[ing] [United Nations] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] support for the [[International Court of Justice]] to provide an advisory opinion on the process in which the former [[Dutch New Guinea]] was ceded to Indonesia in the 1960s\".<ref name=\"RNZI_54332\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=54332 |title=Vanuatu to seek UN General Assembly support for ICJ opinion on Indonesia's Papua |date=23 June 2010 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |access-date=30 September 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.governmentofvanuatu.gov.vu/news.html \"Vanuatu’s Parliament Pass Bill in Support for West Papua\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724142105/http://www.governmentofvanuatu.gov.vu/news.html |date=24 July 2010 }}, Government of Vanuatu</ref><ref>[http://pacific.scoop.co.nz/2010/06/vanuatu-to-seek-observer-status-for-west-papua-at-msg-and-pif-leaders-summits/ \"Vanuatu to seek observer status for West Papua at MSG and PIF leaders summits\"], ''Pacific Scoop'', 22 June 2010</ref>\n\n==International organizational participation==\n\n===Regional relations===\n\nVanuatu maintains strong regional ties in the Pacific.

Vanuatu was admitted to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in 1980 and to the [[United Nations]] in 1981. Vanuatu is currently the only Pacific nation that belongs to the [[Non-Aligned Movement]],\n\nAdditionally outside the region, Vanuatu is a member or participant of the [[ACP (Lomé Convention)]], the [[Alliance of Small Island States]], [[Asian Development Bank]], [[Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] (ESCAP), the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[Group of 77|G-77]], the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]], the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]], the [[International Development Association]], the [[International Finance Corporation]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], the [[International Maritime Organization]], the [[International Olympic Committee]], the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), the [[Universal Postal Union]] and the [[World Meteorological Organization]]. Vanuatu became a member of the WTO in 2012. Vanuatu is also a non-signatory user of [[Intelsat]].\n\nVanuatu became a member of [[Interpol]] in 2018 and is currently a suspended member of the International Hydrographic Organization - since 2019.\n\nOn 4 December 2020, Vanuatu became the sixth ever nation to graduate from the United Nations official list of [[Least developed countries|Least Developed Countries]] (LDC). After meeting graduation thresholds in the Human Assets Index and income in 2006, 2009 and 2012, the UN [[Committee for Development Policy]] recommended graduation. The UN Economic and Social Council and UN General Assembly approved of the recommendation in 2012 and 2013, but after [[Cyclone Pam]] Vanuatu was granted an extension until 2020. The country lost exclusive access to certain international support measures such as in the areas of development assistance and trade.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-12-04|title=Vanuatu graduates from list

Taipei had offered $30 million in aid in return (compared with the $10 million given by the PRC). Under the [[One-China policy]], this would result in the severing of ties with the People's Republic of China.

A spokesman for the Prime Minister denied this a day later. There were reports that previous attempts by Vohor to travel to Taipei were thwarted amid pressure from Beijing so his latest visit was done secretly on purpose. For a period of few weeks, both the PRC and ROC had diplomatic missions posted in Vanuatu while the Vanuatu government was in internal disagreement.\n\nAt one point Prime Minister Serge Vohor punched the PRC ambassador when approached to explain why the [[flag of the Republic of China]] was flying over the hotel where the Taiwanese representative was posted.
