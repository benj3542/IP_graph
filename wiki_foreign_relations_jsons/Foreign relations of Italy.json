At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, Prime Minister [[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando]] focused almost exclusively on territorial gains, but he got far less than he wanted, and Italians were bitterly resentful when they were denied control of the city of [[Fiume]]. The conference, under the control of Britain, France and the United States refused to assign [[Dalmatia]] and Albania to Italy as had been promised in the Treaty of London. Britain, France and Japan divided the German overseas colonies into mandates of their own, excluding Italy. Italy also gained no territory from the breakup of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nItaly did not receive other territories promised by the Treaty of London, so this outcome was denounced as a ''[[Mutilated victory]]''. The rhetoric of ''Mutilated victory'' was adopted by [[Benito Mussolini]] and led to the [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|rise of]] [[Italian fascism]], becoming a key point in the [[propaganda of Fascist Italy]].
