The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] and numerous other agencies play a role in setting policy, and many institutions and businesses have a voice and a role.\n\nThe United Kingdom was the world's [[power in international relations|foremost power]] during the 19th and early 20th centuries, most notably during the so-called \"[[Pax Britannica]]\"{{mdash}}a period of unrivaled supremacy and unprecedented international peace during the mid-to-late 1800s. The country continued to be widely considered a [[superpower]] until the [[Suez crisis]] of 1956 and the dismantling of the [[British Empire]] left the UK's dominant role in global affairs to be gradually diminished. Nevertheless, the United Kingdom remains a [[great power]] and a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]].

British foreign policy initially focused on achieving a [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] within Europe, with no one country achieving dominance over the affairs of the continent. This policy remained a major justification for Britain's wars against Napoleon, and for British involvement in the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s. Secondly Britain continued the expansion of its colonial \"[[First British Empire]]\" by migration and investment.\n\nFrance was the chief enemy until the defeat of Napoleon in 1815. It had a much larger population and a more powerful army, but a weaker navy. The British were generally [[British military history|successful in their many wars]]. The notable exception, the [[American War of Independence]] (1775–1783), saw Britain, without any major allies, defeated by the American colonials who had the support of France, the Netherlands and (indirectly) Spain. A favoured British diplomatic strategy involved subsidising the armies of continental allies (such as [[Prussia]]), thereby turning London's enormous financial power to military advantage. Britain relied heavily on its [[History of the Royal Navy|Royal Navy]] for security, seeking to keep it the most powerful fleet afloat, eventually with a full complement of bases across the globe. British dominance of the seas was vital to the formation and maintaining of the British Empire, which was achieved through the support of a navy larger than the next two largest navies combined, prior to 1920. The British generally stood alone until the early 20th century, when it became friendly with the U.S. and made alliances with Japan, France and Russia and Germany former antagonist now ally.\n\n===1814–1914===\n{{Main|History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom#1814-1914}}\n{{Further|International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)|Foreign policy of William Ewart Gladstone}}\n[[File:Arthur Mees Flags of A Free Empire 1910 Cornell CUL PJM 1167 01 (Reddit source).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Map of the [[British Empire]] (as of 1910).

There were two important wars, both limited in scope. The [[Crimean War]] (1853–1856) saw the defeat of Russia and its threat to the Ottoman Empire. The [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902) saw the defeat of the two Boer republics in South Africa and [[Boxer Rebellion]] happen the same year. London became the world's [[financial centre]], and commercial enterprise expanded across the globe.

The League of Nations proved disappointing to its supporters; it failed to resolve any of the threats posed by the dictators. British policy involved \"appeasing\" them in the hopes they would be satiated. By 1938 it was clear that war was looming, and that Germany had the world's most powerful military. The final act of appeasement came when Britain and France sacrificed [[Czechoslovakia]] to Hitler's demands at the [[Munich Agreement]] of September 1938.<ref>[[David Faber (politician)|David Faber]], ''Munich, 1938: Appeasement and World War II'' (2010)</ref> Instead of satiation, Hitler menaced Poland, and at last Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] dropped appeasement and stood firm in [[Anglo-Polish military alliance|promising to defend Poland]] (31 March 1939).

This declaration included the [[Crown colony|Crown colonies]] and [[British Raj|India]], which Britain directly controlled. The dominions were independent in foreign policy, though all quickly entered the war against Germany. After the French defeat in June 1940, Britain and its empire stood alone in combat against Germany, until June 1941. The United States gave diplomatic, financial and material support, starting in 1940, especially through [[Lend Lease]], which began in 1941 and attain full strength during 1943. In August 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met and agreed on the [[Atlantic Charter]], which proclaimed \"the rights of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they live\" should be respected. This wording was ambiguous and would be interpreted differently by the British, Americans, and nationalist movements.<ref>Keith Sainsbury, ''Churchill and Roosevelt at War: the war they fought and the peace they hoped to make'' (New York University Press, 1994).</ref>\n\nStarting in December 1941, Japan overran [[British possessions]] in Asia, including [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], and especially the key base at [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]]. Japan then marched into [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], headed toward India. Churchill's reaction to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory and the future of the empire was safe, but the rapid defeats irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an [[Imperialism|imperial power]].

The cumulative costs of fighting two world wars, however, placed a heavy burden upon the home economy, and after 1945 the British Empire rapidly began to disintegrate, with all the major colonies gaining independence. By the mid-to-late 1950s, the UK's status as a superpower was gone in the face of the United States and the Soviet Union.
