"{{Short description|none}}\n{{update|date=June 2025}}\n<!-- This short description is INTENTIONALLY \"none\" - please see WP:SDNONE before you consider changing it! -->\n\n{{Politics of Yemen}}\nThe '''foreign relations of Yemen''' are the relationships and policies that [[Yemen]] maintains with other countries. It is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Arab League]], and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]]. Yemen participates in the nonaligned movement. The Republic of Yemen accepted responsibility for all treaties and debts of its predecessors, the YAR and the PDRY. Additionally, Yemen acceded to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] and has stressed the need to render the Middle East region free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction.\n\n==History==\n===North Yemen===\nThe [[geography of Yemen|geography]] and ruling [[Imams of Yemen|Imams]] of [[Kingdom of Yemen|North Yemen]] kept the country isolated from foreign influence before 1962.<ref>Long, David E.; Reich, Bernard (1995). ''The government and politics of the Middle East and North Africa.'' Westview Press (3rd edition). p. 153. {{ISBN|978-0-8133-2125-7}}.</ref> During the 1920s, the government of Yemen forged relations with the Italian government under [[Mussolini]], which led to the [[Italo-Yemeni Treaty]] on September 2, 1926.<ref>Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 67, pp. 384-391.</ref> This gave the Sana'a government diplomatic support vis-a-vis the Saudi government, which had aggressive designs on Yemeni territory. The country's relations with [[Saudi Arabia]] were defined by the [[Saudi-Yemeni war (1934)#Treaty of Taif|Treaty of Taif]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.al-bab.com/yemen/pol/int1.htm |title=The Treaty of Taif, 1934 |access-date=2012-02-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205002149/http://www.al-bab.com/yemen/pol/int1.htm |archive-date=2012-02-05 }}</ref> in 1934 which delineated the northernmost part of the border between the two kingdoms and set the framework for [[commerce]] and other interactions. The Taif Agreement has been renewed periodically in 20-year increments, and its validity was reaffirmed in 1995. Relations with the [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial authorities in [[Aden]] and the south were usually tense.\n\nThe [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[People's Republic of China|Communist Chinese]] Aid Missions established in 1958 and 1959 were the first important non-[[Muslim]] presence in North Yemen. Following the [[North Yemen civil war]], the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] became closely allied with and heavily dependent upon [[Egypt]].<ref>Ismael, Tareq Y.; Ismael, Jacqueline S.; Jaber, Kamel Abu (1991). ''Politics and government in the Middle East and North Africa.'' University Press of Florida. p. 427. {{ISBN|978-0-8130-1043-4}}.</ref> Saudi Arabia aided the royalists in their attempt to defeat the Republicans and did not recognize the Yemen Arab Republic until 1970. Subsequently, Saudi Arabia provided Yemen with substantial budgetary and project support. At the same time, Saudi Arabia maintained direct contact with Yemeni tribes, which sometimes strained its official relations with the Yemeni government. Hundreds of thousands of Yemenis found employment in Saudi Arabia during the late 1970s and 1980s.\n\n[[Ali Abdullah Saleh]]'s foreign policy as the then-president of North Yemen was characterized by the principles of \"positive neutrality\" and Arab unity. Under Saleh, Yemen cultivated close ties with Saudi Arabia and other pro-West states in the region. He also purchased military equipment from the United States and expanded economic relations with the West. At the same time, Saleh also tried to maintain friendly relations with the then-Soviet Union (which broke apart in 1991). In October 1984, he renewed the treaty of Friendship and Cooperation that was originally signed in 1964 by San'a and Moscow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/World-Leaders-2003/Yemen-FOREIGN-POLICY.html#ixzz1ZMt9GQKP|title=Foreign policy - Yemen -}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1989, North Yemen joined [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], and Egypt informing the [[Arab Cooperation Council]] (ACC), an organization created partly in response to the founding of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] and intended to foster closer economic cooperation and integration among its members.<ref>Dresch, Paul (2000). ''A history of modern Yemen.'' Cambridge University Press. p. 181. {{ISBN|978-0-521-79482-4}}.</ref> After unification, the Republic of Yemen was accepted as a member of the ACC in place of its YAR predecessor. In the wake of the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf crisis]], the ACC has remained inactive.\n\n===South Yemen===\nBritish authorities left [[South Yemen]] in November 1967 in the wake of an [[14 October Revolution|intense resistance campaign]]. The [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]], the successor to British colonial rule, had diplomatic relations with many nations, but its major links were with the Soviet Union and other Communist countries. Relations between it and the conservative Arab states of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] were strained. There were [[Al-Wadiah War|military clashes with Saudi Arabia in 1969]] and 1973, and the PDRY provided active support for the [[Dhofar Rebellion]] against the [[Sultan]]ate of [[Oman]]. The PDRY was the only Arab state to vote against admitting new Arab states from the [[Persian Gulf]] area to the [[United Nations]] and the [[Arab League]]. The PDRY provided sanctuary and material support to various international terrorist groups.\n\n===Unified Yemen===\nThe [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf crisis]] dramatically affected Yemen's foreign relations. As a member of the [[UN Security Council]] (UNSC) for 1990 and 1991, Yemen abstained from several UNSC resolutions concerning Iraq and [[Kuwait]] and voted against the \"use of force resolution\". Western and Persian Gulf Arab states reacted by curtailing or canceling aid programs and diplomatic contacts. At least 850,000 Yemenis returned from Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf.\n\nAfter the liberation of Kuwait, Yemen continued to maintain high-level contacts with Iraq. This hampered its efforts to rejoin the Arab mainstream and to mend fences with its immediate neighbors. In 1993, Yemen launched an unsuccessful diplomatic offensive to restore relations with its Persian Gulf neighbors. Some of its aggrieved neighbors actively aided the South during the [[Yemeni civil war (1994)|1994 civil war]]. Since the end of that conflict, tangible progress has been made on the diplomatic front in restoring normal relations with Yemen's neighbors. The Omani-Yemeni border has been officially demarcated. In the summer of 2000, Yemen and Saudi Arabia signed an International Border Treaty settling a 50-year-old dispute over the location of the border between the two countries. Yemen settled its [[Hanish Islands conflict|dispute]] with [[Eritrea]] over the [[Hanish Islands]] in 1998.\n\n==Diplomatic relations==\nList of countries which Yemen maintains diplomatic relations with:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |[[File:Diplomatic relations of Yemen.svg|frameless|425x425px]]\n|-\n!#\n!Country\n!Date\n|-\n|1\n|{{Flag|Italy}}\n|{{dts|2 September 1926}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Britain's position of the Italian Treaty of Yemen 1926-1936 AD |url=https://www.iasj.net/iasj/article/53366 |website=Iraqi Academic Scientific Journals |date=2009 |access-date=2 January 2024 |language=ar}}</ref>\n|-\n|2\n|{{Flag|France}}\n|{{dts|1 June 1942}}<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Liste Chronologique des Ambassadeurs, Envoyés Extraordinaires, Ministres Plénipotentiaires et Chargés D'Affaires de France à L'Étranger Depuis 1945 |url=https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/maep0035-0120_cle8a5377.pdf |journal=Diplomatie.gouv.fr |language=fr |access-date=15 December 2023}}</ref>\n|-\n|3\n|{{Flag|Turkey}}\n|{{dts|4 March 1946}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.tr/relations-between-turkey-and-yemen.en.mfa |title=Bilateral Political Relations between Turkey and the Yemen|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey}}</ref>\n|-\n|4\n|{{Flag|United States}}\n|{{dts|4 March 1946}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=A Guide to the United States' History of Recognition, Diplomatic, and Consular Relations, by Country, since 1776: Yemen |url=https://history.state.gov/countries/yemen |access-date=18 May 2023 |website=history.state.gov}}</ref>\n|-\n|5\n|{{Flag|Egypt}}\n|{{dts|11 April 1946}}<ref>{{Cite book |title=India Quarterly Volume 2 |publisher=Indian Council of World Affairs |year=1946 |pages=313}}</ref>\n|-\n|6\n|{{Flag|United Kingdom}}\n|{{dts|20 January 1951}}<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.120699/page/n1471/mode/2up |title=The Statesman's Year-book |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=1951 |volume=91 |pages=1508 |quote=A fresh agreement between the Yemen and the United Kingdom came into force on 20 Jan., 1951: the establishment of diplomatic relations...}}</ref>\n|-\n|7\n|{{Flag|Pakistan}}\n|{{dts|4 February 1952}}<ref name=\"G.P.

The WTO working party on Yemen met in 2004 and twice thereafter to discuss Yemen's accession; negotiations are expected to take several years.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council===\nYemen desires to join the 24-year-old Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a sub-regional organization which groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman in an economic and security alliance. GCC members have traditionally opposed accession of additional states. Currently, Yemen has partial observer status on some GCC committees, and observers believe that full membership is unlikely. Others assert that it is in the GCC's interest to assist Yemen and prevent it from becoming a failed state, lest its instability spread to neighboring Gulf countries. This has helped Yemen greatly. In November 2006, an international donors' conference was convened in London to raise funds for Yemen's development. Yemen received pledges totaling $4.7&nbsp;billion, which are to be disbursed over four years (2007–2010) and represent over 85% of the government's estimated external financing needs. Much of these pledges came from Yemen's wealthy Arab neighbors.<ref name=crs/>\n\nThe impediments to full GCC membership are steep. Reportedly, Kuwait, still bitter over Yemen's support for Saddam Hussein during the first Gulf War, has blocked further discussion of membership. Meanwhile, Yemen needs to export thousands of its workers each year to the Gulf in order to alleviate economic burdens at home. Foreign remittances are, aside from oil exports, Yemen's primary source of hard currency.<ref name=crs/>\n\n==Arab–Israeli conflict==\nYemen has usually followed mainstream Arab positions on Arab–Israel issues, and its geographic distance from the conflict and lack of political clout make it a minor player in the peace process. Yemen has not established any bilateral mechanism for diplomatic or commercial contacts with Israel. The Yemeni Jewish community (300 members) continues to dwindle, as many of its members emigrated to Israel decades ago. On December 11, 2008, Moshe Nahari, a Jewish teacher, was murdered in a market in Raidah, home to one of the last Jewish communities in Yemen. After the attack, President Saleh pledged to relocate Yemeni Jews to the capital.<ref name=crs/>\n\nYemen supports the [[Arab Peace Initiative]], which calls for Israel's full withdrawal from all occupied territories and the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in exchange for full normalization of relations with all Arab states in the region. In the spring of 2008, President Saleh attempted to broker a reconciliation agreement between the competing Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah. During a March meeting in Sana'a, Palestinian representatives from both groups signed a declaration (the Sana'a Declaration) calling for the creation of a national unity government, but the talks fell apart over the issue of Hamas's role in a unified Palestinian Authority.<ref name=crs/>\n\n==Major international treaties==\nYemen is a signatory to various international agreements on agricultural commodities, commerce, defense, economic and technical cooperation, finance, and postal matters. Yemen is a Non-Annex I country under the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]]. Yemen is not a signatory to the [[Kyoto Protocol]] but has acceded to it, which has the same legal effect as ratification. Yemen is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, is a party to the Biological Weapons Convention, and has signed and ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention. Yemen is also a party to environmental conventions on Biodiversity, [[Desertification]], Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, and Ozone Layer Protection.<ref name=cp/>\n\n== 2010 embassy closures ==\nIn late December 2009, the U.S. Embassy asked Americans in Yemen to keep watch for any suspicious terrorist activity following a [[Northwest Airlines Flight 253|terrorist incident on board a flight to the US]] that was linked to Yemen.<ref name=\"CNN: U.S. Embassy in Yemen closes over terror threats\">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/01/03/yemen.us.embassy/|title=U.S. Embassy in Yemen closes over terror threats|date=3 January 2010|work=[[CNN International]]|access-date=3 January 2010}}</ref> On January 3, 2010, following intelligence<ref name=\"Guardian: US shuts embassy in Yemen after al-Qaida threats\" /> and threats from [[al-Qaeda]], the U.S. embassy in [[Sana'a]] was closed.<ref name=\"Guardian: US shuts embassy in Yemen after al-Qaida threats\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/03/us-shuts-yemen-embassy|title=US shuts embassy in Yemen after al-Qaida threats|author=Matthew Weaver|date=3 January 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=3 January 2010 | location=London}}</ref> A statement issued on the embassy's website said: \"The US Embassy in Sana'a is closed today, in response to ongoing threats by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to attack American interests in Yemen\".<ref name=\"Embassy: Closed in Response to Security Threat\">{{cite web|url=http://yemen.usembassy.gov/embclosed.html|title=Embassy Closed in Response to Security Threat|date=3 January 2010|work=Embassy of the United States: Sana'a, Yemen|access-date=3 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106072138/http://yemen.usembassy.gov/embclosed.html|archive-date=6 January 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Al Jazeera Media Network|Al Jazeera]] reported that the closure of the embassy can mean only that \"they believe al-Qaeda threat is very serious\".
