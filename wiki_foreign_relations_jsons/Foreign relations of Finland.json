Implicitly the government is responsible for internal policy and decision making in the [[European Union]]. Within the government, preparative discussions are conducted in the government committee of foreign and security policy (''ulko- ja turvallisuuspoliittinen ministerivaliokunta''), which includes the [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]] and at least the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Finland)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] and the [[Minister of Defence (Finland)|Minister of Defence]], and at most four other ministers as necessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.valtioneuvosto.fi/hallitus/ministerivaliokunnat/en.jsp |title=Cabinet Committees |access-date=2008-10-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116020927/http://www.valtioneuvosto.fi/hallitus/ministerivaliokunnat/en.jsp |archive-date=January 16, 2009 }}</ref> The committee meets with the President as necessary.

Throughout its existence, Finland has been a [[Democracy|democratic]] state with a [[Market economy|market-based economy]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor six to seven centuries Finland formed an integral part of the [[Sweden|Kingdom of Sweden]], with the process of its incorporation beginning in the 12th century. During the [[Finnish War]], which was linked to the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Russian Empire]] conquered Finland from Sweden. It was subsequently organized as an autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] within the Russian Empire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe roots of Finland’s foreign policy can be traced back to 18th-century Sweden and the [[Caps (party)|Caps Party]]. During the period of autonomy under Russia, long-standing traditions of eastern policy were established.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIndependent Finland began adopting a policy of [[Neutral country|neutrality]] during the 1930s, drawing inspiration from the other [[Nordic countries]] that pursued similar lines. This neutrality continued after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. During the [[Cold War]] Finland expanded its economic cooperation with the West, while maintaining [[bilateral trade]] with the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFollowing the end of the Cold War, Finland purchased [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|Hornet]] fighter aircraft from the [[United States]], joined [[Partnership for Peace|NATO’s Partnership for Peace]] programme in 1994, and became a full partner in 1996. The country became a member of the European Union in 1995 and adopted the euro in 1999. In 1995, it also joined the [[World Trade Organization]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the post‑Cold War era, Finland renounced neutrality but maintained a policy of military [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-alignment]] from the 1990s through the 2010s. This stance came to an end in 2023 when Finland formally acceded to NATO.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Paavo |first=Rautio |date=1992-11-17 |title=WEU:n pääsihteeri: Suomi luopui jo puolueettomuudesta |url=https://www.hs.fi/suomi/art-2000003190266.html |access-date=2025-09-17 |website=Helsingin Sanomat |language=fi}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Suomen tasavallan presidentti: Puheet ja haastattelut |url=https://www.presidentti.fi/halonen/public/default8c7b.html |access-date=2025-09-17 |website=www.presidentti.fi}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Suomen Nato-jäsenyys -jäsenyys |url=https://finlandabroad.fi/web/nato/suomen-nato-jasenyys |access-date=2025-09-17 |website=Suomi ulkomailla: Nato |language=fi-FI}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Tasavallan presidentti Sauli Niinistön puhe suurlähettiläskokouksessa 23.8.2022 |url=https://www.presidentti.fi/niinisto/puheet/tasavallan-presidentti-sauli-niiniston-puhe-suurlahettilaskokouksessa-23-8-2022/ |access-date=2025-09-17 |website=Tasavallan presidentti Sauli Niinistö |language=fi}}</ref>\n\nFrom the period of [[Finland under Swedish rule|Swedish rule]] to the era of independent Finland, the most significant Western trade partners have been [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].

During both stable and turbulent times, Finland has maintained extensive trading relations with its eastern neighbour. Russia has consistently been Finland’s largest trading partner, during the successive eras of the empire, the Soviet Union, and the Russian Federation. These relations have experienced both periods of great expansion and times of severe decline.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2014, when Russia annexed [[Crimea]] from [[Ukraine]], Finland adhered to the European Union’s sanctions policy. It has maintained this stance since [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russia’s invasion of Ukraine]] began in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |title=EU:n Venäjän vastaiset Ukraina-pakotteet (vuodesta 2014) |url=https://www.consilium.europa.eu/fi/infographics/eu-sanctions-against-russia-over-ukraine/ |access-date=2025-09-17 |website=Consilium |language=fi}}</ref>\n\nDuring the decades of neutrality and military non‑alignment, Finland emphasized its role as a mediator between East and West. The most notable example of this diplomatic tradition was the [[Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe|Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (CSCE) held in Helsinki in 1975, which contributed to détente in the Cold War order.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History==\n=== The Kingdom of Sweden 1100-1809 ===\n[[File:Arvid Bernard Horn af Ekebyholm, 1664-1742 (Lorens Pasch d.ä.) - Nationalmuseum - 15699.tif|thumb|Count [[Arvid Horn]]. ]]\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Sweden|Kingdom of Sweden]] granted the Finns the right to manage relations with Russia on a practical level. The center of eastern policy was located in [[Vyborg]]. A key challenge proved to be the synchronization of eastern policy with the [[List of monarchs of Sweden|Swedish monarchs]] residing in [[Stockholm]]. At times, the Finns demanded a firmer stance toward [[Russia]], while Stockholm preferred to maintain a conciliatory approach. At other times, Stockholm sought to tighten its policy toward Russia, but the Finns opposed it. Harmony in eastern policy prevailed only when Stockholm and the Finns shared the same outlook.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tarkiainen |first=Kari |url=https://www.finna.fi/Record/taisto.168673 |title=Moskovalainen: Ruotsi, Suomi ja Venäjä 1478-1721 |date=2022 |publisher=Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura |isbn=978-951-858-576-6 |edition=Tekijän suomentama ja ajantasaistama laitos |series=Historiallisia tutkimuksia |location=Helsinki}}</ref>\n\nFinland’s early foundations of foreign policy date back to the 18th century. [[Sweden]] lost its great power status after the [[Great Northern War]] in 1721. In the 1730s, the so‑called [[Caps (party)|Caps Party]] emerged in Sweden, advocating peaceful relations with Russia. Its leader was Count [[Arvid Horn]], and the Caps Party enjoyed considerable support in Finland. In contrast, the [[Hats (party)|Hats Party]] pursued a more belligerent policy toward Russia and favored an alliance with [[France]]. The Hats gained power and launched the [[Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743)|Russo‑Swedish War (1741-1743)]], known in Finland as the War of the Hats. The war ended in Sweden’s defeat and Finland’s occupation. In the aftermath of the War of the Hats, certain circles within the [[Finnish nobility]] began to entertain the notion of an independent Finland, envisaged as a polity established under the aegis of Russian support. At the same time, discontent was mounting among the Finnish population towards the policies exercised by the [[Finland under Swedish rule|Swedish Crown]], whether in relation to the privileges of the aristocracy or the absolutist rule emanating from [[Stockholm]]. Sweden’s autocratic king [[Gustav III]] later waged war against Russia in 1788, sparking a mutiny among Finland’s officer corps. The plan for the conquest of Finland was conceived around the time of the [[Treaties of Tilsit|Treaty of Tilsit]] between [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic France]] and tsar [[Alexander I of Russia]]. King [[Gustav IV Adolf|Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]] refused to join the [[Continental System]] directed against the [[United Kingdom]]. Alexander showed little enthusiasm for the subjugation of Finland, as he foresaw that the war would bring considerable economic costs. Russia conquered Finland from Sweden in 1809 as part of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |last=Aminoff |first=Jukka |title=Suomen Ruotsi ja Venäjä - Suomi muuttuvien maailmanjärjestysten keskellä |publisher=Readme.fi & WSOY |year=2021 |language=fi |trans-title=Finland, Sweden, and Russia – Finland in the midst of changing world orders}}</ref> \n\n=== The Grand Duchy of Finland - Russian Empire 1809-1917 ===\n[[File:Armfelt.png|thumb|Count [[Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt]]. ]]\nIn 1809, the [[Russian Empire]] turned Finland into a [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Duchy]]. While Finland was not granted its own foreign policy, this period laid the early traditions of an eastern policy toward Russia. Finland’s stance was one of compliance and loyalty to the [[Emperor of Russia|tsars]]. Finland adapted to the [[Foreign policy of the Russian Empire|foreign policy]] pursued by the Russian Empire. This opened for the Finns a perspective on the dynamics of wider world politics. Key figures of Finland's early foreign policy included Count [[Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt]], Count [[Johan Fredrik Aminoff]], Count [[Robert Henrik Rehbinder]], Count [[Carl Erik Mannerheim]], and Count [[Alexander Armfelt]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the aftermath of the political transformations that followed the early nineteenth century, members of the [[Finnish nobility]], together with soldiers and officers, adapted to the new circumstances with notable celerity. Following [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleon's invasion of Russia]] in 1812, a significant number of Finns joined the ranks of the Russian army. Finnish nobles, soldiers and officers played a tangible role during the final campaigns of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], being present within the forces commanded by tsar [[Alexander I of Russia]] that occupied [[Paris]] in 1814.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHigh-ranking Finnish officers and soldiers took part in the [[Caucasian War]] and the [[Russian conquest of Central Asia]]. Finns also participated in the suppression of the Polish uprisings, as well as in wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Japan]], [[Austria-Hungary]], and the [[German Empire]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSeveral states maintained consular representation in the Grand Duchy of Finland. Before the [[World War I|First World War]], accredited consulates were established by [[Sweden]], [[German Empire]], [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Argentina]], [[France]], and the [[United Kingdom]], while the [[United States]], for example, was represented through a Finnish [[Consul (representative)|honorary consul]]. Finnish honorary consuls were chosen primarily from among representatives of trade and shipping.<ref name=\":33\">{{Cite web |title=Suomen itsenäistymistä edeltävä aika: ulkoasioiden hoito autonomian aikana |url=https://um.fi/suomen-itsenaistymista-edeltava-aika |access-date=2025-09-17 |website=Ulkoministeriö |language=fi-FI}}</ref>\n\nIn 1887, Finland had a commercial representative at the [[Embassy of Russia, London|Russian Embassy in London]]. The commercial representative operated under the authority of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], but he was entitled to report directly to Finland on the British economy. The [[British Empire]] was Finland's largest exports market.<ref name=\":33\" />\n\nRussia and France concluded the [[Franco-Russian Alliance|Franco-Russian alliance]] in 1892. The [[Entente Cordiale]] between France and Britain was formed in 1904. In 1907, Russia became a member of the [[Triple Entente]]. At that time Finland did not conduct its own foreign policy, but instead adhered to the policies of Russia. Finnish soldiers participated in the [[World War I|First World War]] in the ranks of the Russian army - including Baron [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-05-22 |title=Suomalaiset ensimmäisessä maailmansodassa |url=https://yle.fi/a/20-152470 |access-date=2025-09-17 |website=Yle Luovat sisällöt ja media |language=fi}}</ref>\n\n=== Early independence ===\n[[File:Gustaf V of Sweden in Helsinki in 1925.jpg|thumb|250x250px|The Swedish royal couple is welcomed to Helsinki.

Following the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in November, Finland declared independence in December 1917. [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] was the first to recognize Finland in 4 January 1918, followed shortly by Sweden, France, and Germany.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Krekola |first=Joni |date=2017 |title=Eduskunta ja itsenäistyminen 1917 - tietopaketti |url=https://www.eduskunta.fi/FI/naineduskuntatoimii/kirjasto/aineistot/yhteiskunta/historia/eduskunta-ja-itsenaistyminen-1917 |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=2025-10-05 |website=Eduskunta}}</ref>\n\nIn late January 1918, Finnish socialists launched a [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]] with the support of Russian Bolsheviks. The anti-communist [[Whites (Finland)|Whites]], in turn, were supported by the [[German Empire]]. German assistance initially took the form of arms shipments and the deployment of [[Finnish Jägers]] trained in Germany. During the Finnish Civil War, Russia and Germany concluded the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], under which most of the Russian troops withdrew from Finland, leaving the Finnish Reds without support. Already in February, Finland's ambassador to Berlin, [[Edvard Hjelt]], had formally requested German military intervention. In April, the German [[Baltic Sea Division]] landed at [[Hanko, Finland|Hanko]] and took Helsinki from the Red Guards.<ref name=\":34\">{{harvnb|Volanen|2017|pages=326-346}}</ref>\n\nTo secure German assistance, Finland and Germany had signed a peace treaty accompanied by a trade agreement that granted significant benefits for German industry. A secret supplementary protocol authorized German forces to establish bases in Finland and to operate through Finnish territory to the Arctic Ocean.<ref name=\":34\" /> After the White victory, a plan to establish a [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|Finnish monarchy]] was set in motion, and [[Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse]], brother-in-law of German Emperor [[Wilhelm II]], was chosen as king-elect. Finland's pro-German policy and the election of a German king led to France to cut diplomatic relations with Finland, and prompted the United States and Great Britain to withhold recognition. U.S. Secretary of State [[Robert Lansing]] considered Finland a German-occupied country.<ref>{{harvnb|Volanen|2017|pp=355-364}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Germany's defeat in the World War I and the [[abdication of Wilhelm II]] also put an end to Finland's monarchy project and forced a reorientation of its foreign policy. German forces withdrew from Finland following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]]. General Baron [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]], who had opposed the pro-German orientation, assumed the position of Regent of Finland. Mannerheim advocated the ''[[Entente Cordiale|entente cordiale]]'', supporting alignment with [[France–United Kingdom relations|Franco–British relations]].<ref name=\":0\" /> A republican constitution was adopted in Finland in 1919, and the Allied powers agreed to recognize Finland following the [[Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)|Paris Peace Conference]].<ref>{{harvnb|Volanen|2017|pp=368-377}}</ref> \n\nThe establishment of closer ties with the [[United Kingdom]] was facilitated by Britain's role as Finland’s principal export market during the era of the Grand Duchy. Relations with [[France]] were in turn eased by the fact that the Russian Empire had been allied with France during the First World War.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Transatlantic relations]] gained importance immediately in the early years of Finland’s independence. [[Herbert Hoover]] was a friend of Finland, and he organized food aid for the country, whose economy had suffered from the First World War, the collapse of the Russian Empire, and the Civil War. The [[United States]] also provided Finland with necessary loans that supported its economy.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n[[Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg]] was elected the first President of the Republic of Finland in 1919. His presidency was characterised by an emphasis on domestic political affairs as Finland sought to consolidate its institutions and identity as a sovereign state. During his term, the only official state visit to Finland was made by the Estonian President, [[Konstantin Päts]]. In foreign policy, Ståhlberg largely delegated authority to Foreign Minister [[Rudolf Holsti]], who pursued the idea of an alliance with the United Kingdom. The proposal, however, failed to gain broad acceptance within Finland’s political establishment.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStåhlberg was succeeded by [[Lauri Kristian Relander]], whose presidency marked a shift in focus toward foreign relations. Relander undertook Finland’s first official state visits abroad and hosted several foreign leaders in Finland. The most significant among these occasions was the visit of King [[Gustaf V|Gustaf V of Sweden]] to Helsinki, which underscored the close historical and cultural ties between the two nations.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Between the world wars ===\nRelations with Soviet Russia from 1918 to 1939 were icy; voluntary expeditions to Russia called [[heimosodat]] ended only in 1922, four years after the conclusion of the Finnish Civil War. However, attempts to establish military alliances were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hicks |first1=Agnes H. |title=''Finland and the Russian Revolution 1917–1922''. By C.

The key responsibilities of Finnish foreign policy were held by moderates and liberals, who supported cultivating close relations with Britain, France, and the [[United States]]. Finland also maintained naturally close relations with [[Sweden]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the [[Baltic region]], new independent states emerged: [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]]. Finland sought cooperation with these countries through the so‑called buffer state policy, intended to safeguard against the threat posed by the Soviet Union. In 1922, Finland signed a treaty with these states, but the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish Parliament]] did not ratify the agreement. Cooperation among the buffer states was complicated by disputes between Poland and Lithuania. The buffer state policy was further weakened by the emergence of mistrust between Poland and France concerning the defence against a potential German threat; France was not prepared to support Poland. Instead, Poland signed a non‑aggression pact with Germany.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== World War II ===\n[[File:Ryti and Rangell's visit to marshal Mannerheim at headquarters 1941 (JOKAOM13HeV mae-3).tif|thumb|[[Risto Ryti]] and [[Marshal Mannerheim]]]]\nIn 1935, Finland publicly declared its withdrawal from the buffer state policy and officially adopted a stance of [[neutral country|neutrality]], in line with the other [[Nordic countries]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPrior to the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Finland’s international trade was predominantly directed towards Western Europe. Commercial relations with the Soviet Union did not recover during the interwar years, owing to the fundamental incompatibility between Finland’s system of [[capitalism]] and [[Private property|private ownership]] and the Soviet Union’s model of a [[planned economy]] and communism. By the 1930s, exports to the Soviet Union accounted for less than one percent of Finland’s total foreign trade.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nWhen the [[Winter War]] broke out, Finland was left alone to resist the Soviet attack. Foreign volunteers also participated in the Winter War, and Finland received supplies from various parts of the world. The Finnish Army succeeded in defending the country against the numerically superior Soviet Union. On the Soviet side, the decision to hasten the conclusion of the conflict was influenced by the willingness of Britain and France to dispatch volunteers in support of Finland. In 1940, Finland and the Soviet Union signed the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]]. As a result of the treaty, Finland was compelled to cede Karelia, Salla, the islands of the [[Gulf of Finland]], the [[Rybachy Peninsula]], and the [[Hanko Peninsula]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy 1940, the situation in the Baltic region had altered dramatically. [[Nazi Germany]] and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland. The Soviet Union annexed Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. In the same year, Nazi Germany occupied [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]]. Finland and Sweden remained the only neutral states in the Baltic Sea region. The two countries considered forming a political union, but Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union obstructed these plans. The Soviet Union had not relinquished its strategic objective of bringing Finland under its control.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |date=2021-06-23 |title=Kun Suomi lähti kesäsotaan ja päätyi pitkään jatkosotaan – tältä kriisiaika 1941–1944 näytti ja tuntui |url=https://yle.fi/a/20-10000935 |access-date=2025-09-15 |website=Elävä arkisto |language=fi}}</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union continued to exert political and economic pressure on Finland. In June 1940, Nazi Germany occupied [[Paris]], and the next stage was the [[Battle of Britain]]. Finland’s only remaining option was partnership with Germany, as no other alternatives existed in the struggle against the Soviet Union. Neither the Finnish state leadership nor the population were enthusiastic about this partnership, yet no viable alternatives were available. Germany, for its part, was interested in cooperation with Finland due to the presence of [[nickel]] deposits in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], a raw material of vital importance for the production of defence equipment.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nLater, during the [[Continuation War]], Finland declared \"co-belligerency\" with Nazi Germany, and allowed Northern Finland to be used as a German attack base. For 872 days, the German army, aided indirectly by Finnish forces, [[Siege of Leningrad|besieged Leningrad]], the Soviet Union's second-largest city.<ref>Michael Jones (2013). \"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uGzfnIm97vQC&pg=PA38 Leningrad: State of Siege]''\".

Marshal [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]] served as President of Finland from 1944 to 1946. He was succeeded by former Prime Minister [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi]], who during the era of the Russian Empire had been a supporter of the policy of conciliation and had served as Finland’s ambassador to Stockholm in the 1930s. Paasikivi, whose background was in the [[Finnish Party|Old Finnish Party]], had already been involved in shaping Finland’s policy of neutrality in the interwar period.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Juho Kusti Paasikivi, 1940s.jpg|thumb|327x327px|After the [[Second World War]], President [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi]], was remembered as the main architect of Finland's foreign policy.<ref>{{Cite book|editor-last=Wilsford|editor-first=David|title=Political leaders of contemporary Western Europe: a biographical dictionary|publisher=Greenwood|year=1995|pages=347–352}}</ref>]]\nPresident Paasikivi showed willingness to participate in the 1947 Paris conference concerning the [[Marshall Plan]], but the Soviet Union prevented Finland’s participation. Nonetheless, Finland succeeded in negotiating favourable loans from the United States, which were repaid with interest.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFinland did not join the Soviet Union's economic sphere ([[Comecon]]) but remained a free-market economy and conducted [[bilateral trade]] with the Soviet Union. \n\nIn 1948, Finland instead signed the [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|Finno–Soviet Treaty]]. Similar treaties were concluded by the [[Eastern Bloc]] states, yet Finland represented a special case, as it remained both democratic and capitalist. Finland received formal Soviet recognition of its neutrality in 1956.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the Cold War, Finland’s foreign policy evolved into what became known as the [[Paasikivi–Kekkonen doctrine|Paasikivi–Kekkonen line]], emphasising neutrality and the cultivation of good relations with countries across the international spectrum. The aim was to remain outside the confrontations of the great powers. To reinforce and interpret this foreign policy principle, the [[Paasikivi Society]] was officially founded in 1958.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThroughout the Cold War, Finland’s diplomacy rested on careful balancing in the sphere of international trade agreements. Finland sought to expand its economic cooperation with both West and East, while maintaining relations with neither side at the expense of the other. The Soviet Union regarded excessive Western integration in Finland’s economic relations as a potential risk of Finland slipping out of its sphere of influence. Conversely, Western states were intent on preventing [[Dual-use technology|dual‑use technologies]] from reaching the Eastern Bloc, while also seeking to ensure that Finland would not drift into becoming part of that bloc.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Presidentti Urho Kekkonen (HK7155-10109).tif|thumb|President [[Urho Kekkonen]] is the longest-serving president in the history of Finland.]]\nA major highlight of Finland’s Cold War history was the [[Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe|Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (CSCE), held in Helsinki in 1975, which brought together the world’s leaders. The event also served as a demonstration of the diplomatic skill of [[Urho Kekkonen]], Finland’s long‑serving president. The purpose of the conference was to promote détente and foster closer relations between the opposing sides of the Cold War.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe participating states signed a treaty that guaranteed the free movement of people and information. This provision became a catalyst for demands for [[human rights]] within the Eastern Bloc. The CSCE conference thus played a role in undermining the [[Iron Curtain]]. Hosting the CSCE was, moreover, an acknowledgement of Finland’s neutrality.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-07-02 |title=Helsingin Etyk 1975: Kommunismi kärsi tappion, Kekkosta jännitti kovasti |url=https://yle.fi/a/3-8122777 |access-date=2025-09-15 |website=Yle Uutiset |language=fi}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1975 onwards, the Soviet Union became Finland’s largest export market, overtaking the United Kingdom. This shift was largely due to Britain’s departure from the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) to join the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), which created customs barriers that hampered trade between Britain and Finland, as Finland was only an associate member of EFTA. Finland signed a free trade agreement with the EEC in 1973, but most tariffs were not removed until 1977, with the final tariffs eliminated in 1985.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFinland and the Soviet Union maintained a closely regulated bilateral trade relationship characterized by five-year trade agreements that specified export quotas for Finnish manufactured goods, machinery, and transport equipment in exchange for Soviet crude oil and mineral fuels. Trade was largely balanced annually through barter arrangements. The Soviet Union was not only Finland's biggest trading partner but also offered favorable conditions, including premiums on Finnish exports compared to Western markets. This subsidized trade relationship helped support Finnish industry and economic stability during the oil crises of the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal |last=Simola |first=Heli |date=2006 |title=Russia in the Finnish Economy |journal=Sitra Reports |publication-place=Helsinki}}</ref>\n\nThe President of the United States [[Ronald Reagan]] conducted a three-day state visit to Finland in 1988, hosted by President [[Mauno Koivisto]].

W. Bush|George H.W. Bush]] and Soviet General Secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. The agenda of the summit prominently featured the issue of [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait|Iraq's invasion of Kuwait]], which had precipitated international tensions. The discussions foreshadowed the subsequent [[Gulf War]], which resulted in the liberation of [[Kuwait]] from [[Iraq|Iraqi]] control.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-07-11 |title=Summit host Helsinki has played a \"peaceful note for the world\" |url=https://yle.fi/a/20-272498 |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Elävä arkisto |language=fi}}</ref>\n\nThe trade partnership persisted as the Soviet Union remained Finland’s largest export destination until the USSR’s collapse in 1991, after which the dynamics of Finnish foreign trade shifted dramatically. The collapse of this trade regime had significant economic repercussions for Finland, as a substantial share of its exports and industrial sectors depended on the Soviet market. The Soviet trade relationships were also politically significant and symbolized a form of peaceful coexistence during the Cold War era.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Dissolution of the Soviet Union ===\nAfter the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Finland unilaterally abrogated the last restrictions imposed on it by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris peace treaties of 1947]] and the Finno-Soviet [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance]]. The government filed an application for membership in the [[European Union]] (EU) three months after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\nFinland officially established its relations with [[NATO]] in 1992 when it participated as an observer in the [[North Atlantic Cooperation Council]] (NACC) foreign ministers’ meeting. This marked the beginning of Finland’s engagement with NATO cooperation mechanisms following the end of the Cold War, motivated primarily by the need to monitor security developments in neighboring [[Russia]] and the [[Baltic states]]. Negotiations to join [[Partnership for Peace|NATO’s Partnership for Peace]] (PfP) were initiated in 1993, and Finland formally joined the PfP program in 1994. Initially, Finland’s cooperation with NATO was restricted to non-combat areas such as rescue operations, peacekeeping training, and environmental protection.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |date=2015-04-17 |title=Mutkikas tie Naton luo |url=https://yle.fi/a/20-127413 |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Yle Luovat sisällöt ja media |language=fi}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal |last=Ritvanen |first=Juha-Matti |date=2025 |title=Empivä kumppani.

This legal framework enabled Finland’s full engagement in the Bosnia [[Implementation Force|IFOR]] peacekeeping mission in 1996 as an full and active peace partner.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nConcurrently, efforts to align the Finnish Defence Forces' compatibility with NATO military standards were formalized through agreements signed in 1995. Further integration steps included the establishment of a special Finnish mission to NATO headquarters in [[Brussels]] in 1997, enhancing Finland’s involvement in NATO decision-making processes while maintaining its policy of military non-alignment.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n[[File:Visit of Mauno Koivisto, President of Finland, to the CEC.jpg|thumb|President [[Mauno Koivisto]] with [[Jacques Delors]], President of the CEC.]]\nFinland undertook several significant foreign and defence policy decisions in the 1990s. The country acquired 68 American [[F-18 Hornet]] fighter aircraft in 1992, entered NATO’s Partnership for Peace programme in 1994, and joined the European Union in 1995. In 1995, Finland reinforced Western economic integration by joining the second stage of the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]], followed by entry into the third stage in 1999, which introduced the euro currency.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAccession to the European Union marked the abandonment of Finland’s long-standing neutrality policy. By joining, Finland accepted the [[Maastricht Treaty]], which laid the foundation for the European Union’s Common Foreign and Security Policy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFrom 1995 onwards, Finland adopted a policy of military [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-alignment]], positioning itself as a state outside formal defence alliances. At the same time, the government reserved the so‑called NATO option, maintaining the possibility of applying for NATO membership in the future if national or international circumstances required.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the presidency of [[Martti Ahtisaari]] in the 1990s, successive coalition governments brought Finland closer to the institutional core of the European Union. At the time, Finland was widely regarded as a cooperative model state within the Union and did not oppose initiatives aimed at establishing a common European defence policy.\n\nThis orientation shifted in the following decade. Under President [[Tarja Halonen]] and Foreign Minister [[Erkki Tuomioja]], Finland adopted a more cautious line, making it an official policy to resist other EU members’ proposals for common defence structures. Nonetheless, despite this general reluctance, Finland joined the [[European Union Battlegroups]] in 2006 and the [[NATO Response Force]] in 2008, marking limited yet significant steps in multilateral security cooperation.\n[[File:Martti Ahtisaari Mäntyniemessä.jpg|thumb|[[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate, President [[Martti Ahtisaari]].]]\nFinland’s role in shaping its relationship with Russia in the late 20th and early 21st centuries is closely tied to its pioneering work in the establishment of the [[Northern Dimension|European Union’s Northern Dimension]] policy. Introduced in 1998 during Finland’s EU Presidency, the Northern Dimension was a strategic initiative aimed at fostering cooperation and sustainable development in the northern regions of Europe, which included the EU, Russia, Norway, and [[Iceland]] as equal partners. This policy addressed the unique challenges and opportunities of the EU’s new eastern and northern borders, specifically promoting stability, environmental protection, economic prosperity, and social well-being in cross-border areas around the Baltic Sea and the [[Arctic]].<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web |title=René Nyberg: EU-Russian Relations from the Point of View of the Finnish EU Presidency -Russian Relations from the Point of View of the Finnish EU Presidency |url=https://um.fi/speeches/-/asset_publisher/up7ecZeXFRAS/content/rene-nyberg-eu-russian-relations-from-the-point-of-view-of-the-finnish-eu-presidency |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Ministry for Foreign Affairs |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe Northern Dimension was conceived to manage the interdependencies between the EU and Russia, focusing on sectors such as environmental issues, nuclear safety, and the socio-economic development of border regions, including [[Kaliningrad]]. Finland’s geographic and political position made it a key driver of this policy, leveraging its EU membership since 1995 to facilitate a cooperative framework with Russia rather than antagonism.<ref name=\":6\" />\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev with Tarja Halonen at a press conference following Russian-Finnish talks.jpg|thumb|President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] and President [[Tarja Halonen]] in Helsinki in 2009. ]]\nDuring the 1990s, Finnish exports to Russia recovered gradually after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the severe trade disruptions that followed. The economic situation in Russia came to stabilize during the 2000s, resulting in increased bilateral trade. By 2008, Russia had regained its status as Finland’s largest export market, fuelled not only by industrial goods but also by the growing presence of Russian consumers who contributed to Finland’s economic vitality. President [[Tarja Halonen]]’s tenure was marked by the cultivation of close and constructive relations with Russian leadership, further consolidating Finland’s role as a bridge between the EU and Russia.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Suomen ulkomaankaupan lyhyt historia |url=https://www.eurojatalous.fi/fi/2015/5/suomen-ulkomaankaupan-lyhyt-historia/ |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Euro ja talous |language=fi}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThus, the Northern Dimension policy and the strengthening of bilateral trade relations underpinned Finland’s strategic approach to Russia in this period, balancing economic cooperation with political pragmatism to maintain stability and regional integration in Northern Europe.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThis structured approach positioned Finland as both a mediator and a facilitator in EU-Russian relations through the early 21st century, reflecting its unique geopolitical circumstances and historical ties.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRelations with Russia were generally cordial, with recurring issues including bureaucracy at the [[Vaalimaa]] border crossing, airspace violations, development aid Finland provides to Russia - particularly to address environmental problems impacting Finland - and Finland's energy dependency on Russian [[gas]] and [[electricity]]. The Vaalimaa border crossing, opened in 1958, was the busiest between Finland and Russia and among the busiest land crossings in the European Union. \n\nIn 2005, the number of foreign spies in Finland returned to Cold War levels. Espionage activity was concentrated in the [[Helsinki metropolitan area]], where the nation’s political leadership, largest corporations, and principal research institutions are located. The capital also hosts foreign embassies, through which, according to experts, the majority of espionage is conducted. According to information published by ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', approximately 50 trained spies representing the intelligence services of various countries were then operating in Finland. Most of them were based within the area of [[Ring III|Ring Road III]], posing as diplomats, journalists, researchers, businesspeople, grant holders, or students. Of these, an estimated 30 focused on civilian intelligence, while 20 concentrated on gathering military-related information.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pietiläinen |first=Tuomo |last2=Parkkonen |first2=Santtu |last3=teksti |last4=Gröndahl |first4=Jukka |last5=kuvat |date=2005-11-16 |title=Helsingistä tuli jälleen vakoilun keskus |url=https://www.hs.fi/pkseutu/art-2000004352832.html |access-date=2025-09-20 |website=Helsingin Sanomat |language=fi}}</ref> \n\n=== Change in constitution ===\nIn 2000, a major reform was made to the [[Constitution of Finland]], which repealed the previously valid four separate constitutional laws and created a unified, modernised Constitution. This reform particularly signified a significant shift in the leadership of foreign policy.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web |last=Oikeusministeriö |title=2.1 Suomen perustuslaki |url=https://lainkirjoittaja.finlex.fi/2-valtiojarjestyksen-perusteet/2-1/ |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Lainkirjoittajan opas |language=fi}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Constitution of 2000, foreign policy is led by the President of the Republic in cooperation with the Council of State (the government). This means that the President’s power in foreign affairs is no longer exclusive but emphasizes collaboration with the [[Finnish Government|government]]. Additionally, due to EU membership, the leadership of foreign policy was divided: the Council of State was given decision-making authority in preparing EU affairs and national measures, while the President retained responsibility for traditional foreign policy outside the EU. In practice, this transferred much power from the President to the [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]] and the government, while also increasing the role of Parliament.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web |last=Saukkonen |first=Pasi |title=4.1 Suomen kansainväliset suhteet ja ulkopolitiikka {{!}} Suomen poliittinen järjestelmä – verkkokirja |url=https://blogs.helsinki.fi/vol-spj/ulkopolitiikka/suomen-ulkopolitiikan-eurooppalaistuminen/ |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=The University of Helsinki}}</ref>\n\nWith this change, the President’s power in domestic politics was significantly reduced, and the Prime Minister became the key decision-maker in forming the government and leading the EU aspect of foreign policy. Except in times of crisis, the Constitution of 2000 emphasized cooperation and the President’s role is focused on foreign and security policy, but with more limited supervision and authority than before.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe Constitution of 2000 strengthened parliamentarism and transformed the President’s position into a dual leadership in foreign policy: the President and the Council of State lead foreign policy together, with the Council of State and Prime Minister having a strong role in EU matters. This pushed Finland toward a more modern, parliamentary system of leadership in foreign policy. The arrangement has been criticised for not providing a simple answer of who's in charge if there is a major dispute.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\"foreignpolicyidea\">[http://www.eva.fi/files/2170_suomen_ulkopolitiikan_idea_.pdf \"Finland's foreign policy idea\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217105340/http://www.eva.fi/files/2170_suomen_ulkopolitiikan_idea_.pdf|date=December 17, 2008}} (\"Suomen ulkopolitiikan idea\"), [[Risto E.

President [[Sauli Niinistö]] adopted what became known as a “stability policy” aimed at mitigating tensions between the West and Russia, reflecting a desire to maintain dialogue and avoid escalations amidst growing geopolitical instability.<ref name=\":0\" />[[File:President of the United States Donald Trump & President of Finland Sauli Niinistö Joint Press Conference, August 28, 2017.jpg|thumb|250px|President Niinistö with US President [[Donald Trump]] in 2017.]] \n\nPresident Niinistö’s diplomatic approach stayed rooted in pragmatism and continuity, echoing the principles of President Juho Kusti Paasikivi, seeking stable and functional relations with Russia despite the escalating conflict. Notably, Finland hosted a 2018 summit in Helsinki between U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] and Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], underlining its role as a neutral ground for dialogue. Putin also visited Finland as Niinistö’s guest in 2019, exemplifying this continuing diplomatic engagement.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis paradigm shift in Finnish foreign policy signals a new era marked by increased military preparedness, intensified international cooperation, and a commitment to upholding European security architecture, while acknowledging the complex realities of Finland’s geopolitical position.<ref name=\":0\" />[[File:President Joe Biden poses for a photo with Alexander Stubb and Justin Trudeau after a meeting of the North Atlantic Council (53847935047).jpg|thumb|President [[Alexander Stubb]] with President [[Joe Biden]], and Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] after a meeting of the [[North Atlantic Council]], during the [[2024 Washington NATO summit|NATO Summit]].]]Among the most significant repercussions was Finland’s historic decision in May 2022 to apply for [[Member states of NATO|NATO membership]], ending decades of military non-alignment. Finland joined NATO in April 2023. This decision was driven by increased perceptions of threat from Russia, which undermined the credibility of bilateral security assurances.

It fundamentally combines a value base - Western values such as democracy, the rule of law, and human rights - with a pragmatically grounded realism in foreign policy that also takes national interests and global realities into account. This means that Finland adheres firmly to its core values while remaining open to dialogue with countries that do not share the same values. According to Stubb, value-based realism allows flexibility in balancing values and realism depending on the situation, providing broad maneuvering room for foreign policy.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-12-30 |title=Analyysi: Kielioppikin sen jo vahvistaa – Stubbin ulkopolitiikassa arvot joustavat realismin edessä |url=https://yle.fi/a/74-20131643 |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Yle Uutiset |language=fi}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-06-13 |title=Tätä tarkoittaa Stubbin ”arvopohjainen realismi” |url=https://yle.fi/a/74-20093832/64-3-235009 |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Yle Uutiset |language=fi}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Pekkarinen |first=Virpi |date=2024-08-27 |title=Tasavallan presidentti Alexander Stubbin puhe suurlähettiläskokouksessa 27.8.2024 |url=https://www.presidentti.fi/tasavallan-presidentti-alexander-stubbin-puhe-suurlahettilaskokouksessa-27-8-2024/ |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Presidentti |language=fi}}</ref>\n==Multilateral relations==\nSince 1917, Finland has joined numerous multilateral organizations. Key ones include:\n\n* [[League of Nations]] (1920)\n* [[Bank for International Settlements]] (1930)\n* [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) (1948)\n* [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (World Bank) (1948)\n* [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) (1950)\n* [[United Nations]] (UN) (1955)\n* [[Nordic Council]] (1955)\n* [[International Finance Corporation]] (1956)\n* [[International Development Association]] (1960)\n* [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) (1961, until 1994)\n* [[Asian Development Bank]] (1966)\n* [[OECD|Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD) (1969)\n* [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) (1973)\n* [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (1977)\n* [[African Development Bank]] (1982)\n* [[Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency]] (1988)\n* [[Council of Europe]] (1989)\n* [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD) (1991)\n* [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) (1995)\n* [[European Union]] (EU) (1995)\n* [[Schengen Area]] (2001)\n* [[Intelsat|INTELSAT]] (1999)\n* [[Partnership for Peace|NATO Partnership for Peace]] (1994) and full [[NATO]] membership (2023)\n\n=== The League of Nations ===\nFinland joined the [[League of Nations]] in 1920 mainly for security and international legitimacy reasons. The membership was intended to strengthen Finland's international position, especially against the Soviet Union, which remained a significant threat after Finland's 1917 independence and subsequent civil war. Joining the League also gave Finland a voice in international cooperation and provided a platform to resolve regional disputes, most notably the [[Åland|Åland Islands]] question, where the League in 1921 decided the islands would remain an [[Autonomy|autonomous]] and [[Demilitarized zone|demilitarized]] part of Finland. This membership helped Finland secure its sovereignty as a young independent nation and gain recognition and support in the international community during the unstable interwar period. The League membership was a cornerstone of Finland's early foreign policy and part of its efforts to cooperate with Scandinavian and Baltic neighbors for regional security.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Maailmansotien välinen aika: ulkoasiainhallinnon vakiintuminen |url=https://um.fi/maailmansotien-valinen-aika |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Ulkoministeriö |language=fi-FI}}</ref>\n\n=== The Bank for international Settlements ===\nFinland joined the [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS) in 1930 because the BIS was established as an international financial institution to facilitate international financial arrangements and cooperation between central banks.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Finland |first=Bank of |title=International cooperation |url=https://www.suomenpankki.fi/en/bank-of-finland/our-strategy/international-cooperation/ |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Bank of Finland |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== The International Monetary Fund (IMF) ===\nFinland joined the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) in 1948 for several key reasons related primarily to post-war reconstruction, economic stability, and the need for foreign financing. Established by the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods agreements]], the IMF aimed to maintain international currency stability and promote global economic cooperation. For Finland, IMF membership provided access to foreign dollar credits crucial for the country's economic recovery and development during the difficult post-war years.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web |last=Finland |first=Bank of |title=International cooperation |url=https://www.suomenpankki.fi/en/bank-of-finland/our-strategy/international-cooperation/ |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Bank of Finland |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Viikon kysymys: Mikä on IMF ja mitkä ovat sen tehtävät? |url=https://ek.fi/ajankohtaista/blogit/viikon-kysymys-mika-on-imf-ja-mitka-ovat-sen-tehtavat/ |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Elinkeinoelämän keskusliitto |language=fi}}</ref><ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal |last=Liikanen |first=Erkki |date=2014-05-14 |title=Erkki Liikanen: The country that paid its debt, became an early member of the IMF, and joined the EU |url=https://www.bis.org/review/r140514h.htm |journal=Bank of Finland |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Finnish government had already decided in 1946 to apply for membership as part of a strategy to join the new Western economic system. Membership also strengthened Finland's integration into the Western financial system, despite political uncertainties due to Soviet influence. Joining the IMF committed Finland to international monetary rules, enhanced the convertibility of the [[Finnish markka]] internationally, and facilitated the growth of trade and economic cooperation. This membership was a significant step for Finland’s international economic relations and foreign policy in the post-war decades.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== The World Bank ===\nFinland joined the World Bank in 1948 as part of the post-World War II international reconstruction and economic system. The World Bank was established to finance the rebuilding of Europe and Japan, initially focusing on infrastructure such as roads, airports, and power plants. Finland's membership was considered a crucial step in financing postwar reconstruction and strengthening economic integration with the West. The Finnish government decided as early as 1946 to apply for membership because World Bank loans offered opportunities for economic development and acquisition of foreign capital, especially for industry and infrastructure advancement. The membership was also politically significant, reinforcing Finland's integration into the Western monetary system and international trade. The first loans were granted in 1949 and helped alleviate Finland's chronic capital and foreign exchange shortages in the postwar years. This membership was strategically important in Finland’s path toward becoming part of the Western free-trade and economic system.<ref>''Rajamaata rauhoittamassa : Maailmanpankin muuttuva Suomi-kuva kehitysrahoituksen kaudella 1948–1975'' (2016).

Turun yliopisto. </ref>\n\n=== General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) ===\nFinland joined [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]] in 1950 with the goal of securing tangible economic benefits. The GATT agreement offered a general reduction in tariffs, which facilitated Finnish exports because the same tariff benefits applied to all members of the system, eliminating the need to negotiate separately with each country. Membership also made it possible to move away from old bilateral trade agreements whose tariffs were based on outdated currency standards. Although tariffs had to be lowered, protective tariffs could still be maintained in certain sectors, and trade with Eastern countries remained outside GATT’s scope. Finland wished to remain part of economic development as the [[Nordic countries]] were simultaneously planning a customs union. The forest and export industries pushed for membership because it brought tariff concessions and strengthened Finland's position in exports. The [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish Parliament]] approved membership in 1950, and joining helped break down trade barriers based on bilateralism, allowing Finland to engage in freer trade and integration with Western countries.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-01-26 |title=Kansainvälisen tullipäivän historia on lukemattomien lyhenteiden historiaa |url=https://tulli.fi/-/kansainvalisen-tullipaivan-historia-on-lukemattomien-lyhenteiden-historiaa |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Tulli |language=fi-FI}}</ref>\n\n=== The United Nations (UN) ===\nFinland joined the [[United Nations]] (UN) in 1955 because its membership became possible only after the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty of 1947]], which came after [[World War II]]. Finland was not one of the victors of the war, so it could not be a founding member of the UN. Due to political disputes among the [[Cold War]] superpowers - mainly the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] - the admission of new members was delayed. Finland was accepted in 1955 as part of a package deal when tensions between the superpowers had eased. Finland emphasized [[Neutral country|neutrality]] in its UN policy, which was crucial for its position within the Soviet sphere of influence, while maintaining a Western societal model. Joining the UN marked an important step for Finland in gaining international recognition and engaging more actively in global cooperation and diplomacy. The membership acceptance coincided with the return of the [[Porkkala Naval Base|Porkkala naval base]], which further enabled Finland to credibly pursue its neutral stance in the UN.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Suomi valitaan YK:n jäseneksi joulukuussa 1955 |url=https://www.eduskunta.fi/FI/naineduskuntatoimii/kirjasto/aineistot/kv-jarjestot/Suomen-liittyminen-YKhon/Sivut/suomi-YKn-jaseneksi.aspx |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20240810214547/https://www.eduskunta.fi/FI/naineduskuntatoimii/kirjasto/aineistot/kv-jarjestot/Suomen-liittyminen-YKhon/Sivut/suomi-YKn-jaseneksi.aspx |archive-date=2024-08-10 |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=www.eduskunta.fi}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Suomi YK:ssa {{!}} Suomen YK-liitto |url=https://www.ykliitto.fi/tietoa-yksta/suomi-ykssa |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=www.ykliitto.fi |language=fi}}</ref>\n\nFinland began its involvement in United Nations peacekeeping missions in 1956, shortly after joining the UN in December 1955. The first deployment was to the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF I) in the [[Suez Canal]] area, making Finland one of the first countries to respond positively to the UN Secretary-General’s call for peacekeeping troops during the [[Suez Crisis]].

A particularly notable contribution has been to the [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization]] (UNTSO) in the [[Middle East]], where Finnish peacekeepers have served continuously since 1967, establishing Finland as a consistent and valued troop contributor.

The seriousness of this commitment is underscored by the fact that 39 Finnish peacekeepers have lost their lives in service since 1956. As of recent years, Finland continues to deploy over 200 personnel to various missions, including the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] (UNIFIL), affirming its ongoing and substantial involvement in UN peacekeeping operations.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThis longstanding engagement demonstrates Finland’s dedication to multilateral peace initiatives and its status as a respected and reliable partner in United Nations peacekeeping endeavors.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAs of March 2011 Finland maintains diplomatic relations with all UN member states.<ref>{{cite web |title=Diplomatic relations established between Finland and Kiribati |url=http://formin.finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=216545&nodeid=17370&contentlan=2&culture=en-US |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023083830/http://formin.finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=216545&nodeid=17370&contentlan=2&culture=en-US |archive-date=October 23, 2017 |access-date=December 24, 2017 |website=Formin.finland.fi}}</ref>\n\n=== Nordic Council ===\nFinland joined the [[Nordic Council]] in 1955 after a careful consideration shaped by both international and regional circumstances. Following the death of the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], relations between Finland and the Soviet Union warmed, reducing tensions that had previously constrained Finnish foreign policy. This thaw allowed Finland to engage in broader regional cooperation without provoking Soviet disapproval. Committed to a policy of neutrality and maintaining peaceful bilateral relations, Finland utilized the opportunity to join the Nordic Council as a means of asserting its political and cultural identity as part of the Nordic community. This step also reinforced its neutral stance in the context of Cold War geopolitics.\n\nThe Nordic Council had been established in 1952 as a cooperative forum initially including [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]]. Finland's accession in 1955 completed the Nordic cooperation framework, emphasizing cultural, social, economic, and political collaboration among the member states while respecting national sovereignty. Joining the Nordic Council in the same year that Finland became a member of the [[United Nations]] symbolized Finland’s commitment to peace, stability, and multilateral engagement within the Nordic region.\n\nThus, Finland’s membership in the Nordic Council in 1955 was a strategic move aligned with its foreign policy objectives of neutrality and regional cooperation during a period when its external relations became less restrictive due to changes in Soviet leadership. It signified Finland’s belonging to the Nordic group both politically and culturally, without compromising its independent foreign policy.\n\n'''The International Finance Corporation'''\n\nFinland joined the [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC) in 1956 as one of the original founding member countries at the time of the organization’s establishment. The IFC was created as a member of the [[World Bank Group]] with the specific purpose of fostering economic development by encouraging the growth of productive private enterprises, particularly in less developed countries. It was designed to complement the World Bank’s focus on government-backed projects by investing directly in private sector ventures without government guarantees and without taking management control. Finland’s accession to the IFC reflected its alignment with the global initiative to promote private sector-led economic growth and development. This step corresponded with Finland’s broader national economic goals during the mid-20th century, a period marked by efforts to stimulate industrial expansion and embed Finland within emerging international financial cooperation frameworks. The IFC's Articles of Agreement came into force in 1956, marking the formal operational start of the institution, which initially had capital of $100 million and staff dedicated to promoting private investments worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tvedt |first=John |year=1966 |title=Stabilizing an Economy: Finland |url=https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/022/0003/002/article-A004-en.xml |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=www.elibrary.imf.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |year=2003 |title=Origins of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) |url=https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/167361467990972836/pdf/104636-WP-PUBLIC-2003-03-Origins-of-the-IFC.pdf |journal=World Bank Document}}</ref>\n\n=== The International Development Association (IDA) ===\nFinland joined the [[International Development Association]] (IDA) as part of its long-standing commitment to international development cooperation and sustainable development. This membership aligns with Finland’s broader development policy, which aims to reduce poverty and inequality while promoting economic growth, gender equality, climate action, and the rights of vulnerable populations globally. Finland’s engagement with the IDA reflects its foreign and security policy goals by fostering international cooperation through concessional financing targeted at the world’s poorest countries. By joining IDA, Finland strategically positions itself to support global development challenges, consistent with its principles of human rights, democratic governance, and sustainable resource use. The decision complements Finland’s historical transition from aid recipient to development donor and its active participation in international organizations that promote peace, security, and economic development.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Finland to support International Development Association, which funds world’s poorest countries |url=https://valtioneuvosto.fi/en/-/finland-to-support-international-development-association-which-funds-world-s-poorest-countries |access-date=2025-09-16 |work=Finnish Government |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Goals and principles of Finland’s development policy |url=https://finlandabroad.fi/web/mda/goals-and-principles-of-development-policy |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Suomi ulkomailla: Moldova |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) ===\nFinland joined the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) as an associate member in 1961 in order to secure freer access to Western European markets and to strengthen its national economy through expanded trade opportunities. At the time, Finland’s principal trading partners, such as the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Sweden]], were among the founding members of EFTA, and Finland’s economy was heavily reliant on exports to Western Europe, particularly in sectors like woodworking and paper products. Finnish policymakers viewed associate membership as a strategic economic move to enable competitiveness within a growing regional free trade area alongside its Nordic neighbors.<ref>{{Cite web |last=admin |date=2023-12-11 |title=Finland in EU {{!}} Everything About Finland's Membership in the EU |url=https://finlandq.com/finland-in-eu/ |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Finland Startup Visa & Company Registration In Finland |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":16\">{{Cite journal |last=Liikanen |first=Erkki |date=2017-11-14 |title=Erkki Liikanen: Finland, UK and the European Union |url=https://www.bis.org/review/r171114g.htm |journal=BIS |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe path to membership was shaped by significant geopolitical considerations arising from Finland’s delicate position during the Cold War, with strong influence exerted by the [[Soviet Union]] over Finnish affairs. Due to this, Finland’s association with EFTA was carefully negotiated to emphasize the organization’s strictly economic and non-political character, enabling Finland to integrate economically with Western Europe without undermining its special relationship and political neutrality toward the Soviet Union. [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] solidarity, especially persistent advocacy from Sweden, also played a key role in facilitating Finland’s entry. This pragmatic approach allowed Finland to benefit from greater economic cooperation with the West while managing its geopolitical constraints, thus marking an important step in Finland’s gradual Western economic integration during the early 1960.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n=== The Asian Development Bank (ADB) ===\nFinland joined the [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB) in 1966 as one of its founding members when the bank was established on December 19, 1966. The ADB was created as a regional multilateral development bank to foster economic growth and cooperation in the [[Asia]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific region]]. Its purpose was to mobilize development financing and support social and economic development in Asia, complementing broader international efforts such as those by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East]] (now UNESCAP).<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite journal |year=1965 |title=The Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank |url=https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/MTDSG/Volume%20I/Chapter%20X/X-4.en.pdf |journal=The United Nations}}</ref>\n\nThe bank was modeled closely on the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] and aimed to be \"Asian in character,\" addressing the developmental challenges of some of the poorest regions in the world at the time. Although the majority of members were from Asia and the Pacific, the ADB admitted non-regional developed countries, including Finland, which participated in this institution to support development financing and economic cooperation in Asia.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nThe creation of the ADB was driven by a cooperative effort led by [[Japan]] and endorsed by major powers like the [[United States]]. It was founded in the context of rising regional identity and development needs following decolonization and economic transformation in Asia. Finland's early membership reflected its broader foreign policy commitment to multilateralism and international development cooperation.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nThe bank's headquarters was established in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], after a vote among prospective members, and the first president was a Japanese economist, reflecting Japan's prominent role in the bank's creation.

The decision was primarily a logical and strategic step in a long-standing process of economic integration with Western countries. During this period, Finland had been gradually intensifying its economic and commercial ties with OECD member states, reflecting its ambition to modernize and transform from an agrarian economy into a diversified, export-oriented welfare state.<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web |last=Finland |first=Bank of |title=International cooperation |url=https://www.suomenpankki.fi/en/bank-of-finland/our-strategy/international-cooperation/ |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Bank of Finland |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":19\">{{Cite journal |last=Carroll |first=Peter |year=2020 |title=Finland’s cautious path to OECD membership |url=https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2019/01/finland-s-cautious-path-to-oecd-membership_513bf539/5ee17ef3-en.pdf |journal=OECD Observer}}</ref>\n\nPolitically, Finland aimed to bolster its image as a modern, highly industrialized Western market economy. At the same time, membership in the OECD was part of Finland’s careful effort to gradually distance itself from the Soviet Union's influence while preserving its policy of [[Neutral country|neutrality]] amid [[Cold War]] tensions. The Soviet Union was initially skeptical about Finland’s membership due to the OECD’s association with Western countries linked to NATO. To address these concerns, Finnish President [[Urho Kekkonen]] provided political guarantees to the Soviet Union, ensuring a delicate geopolitical balance.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\nBefore full membership, Finland had observer status in the OECD starting in 1961 and was also an associate member of the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). Joining the OECD enabled Finland to deepen its participation in global trade networks, reinforce its commitment to free trade and economic modernization, and align more closely with Western market economies.<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" />\n\nFinland's accession to the OECD marked a significant milestone in its post-war economic development and international cooperation. By joining the OECD, Finland gained access to a platform for economic policy exchange, benchmarking, and research-based advice, which helped guide its evolution into one of the leading knowledge-based economies, known today for innovation, education, and social welfare.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\n=== The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) ===\nFinland joined the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), initially known as the [[Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (CSCE), in 1973 to promote regional and national security through a broad and inclusive forum linking the European international system. This initiative was deeply rooted in Finland's geopolitical position as a [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] and [[neutral country]] during the [[Cold War]], aiming to have its policy of neutrality recognized and upheld by both the [[Western Bloc|Western]] and [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern]] blocs. Finland sought to foster dialogue between East and West and support a security paradigm that combined political, military, human rights, and economic cooperation to stabilize the tense [[East–West dichotomy|East-West relations]].<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite web |title=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe -operation in Europe |url=https://um.fi/-the-organization-for-security-and-co-operation-in-europe |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Ministry for Foreign Affairs |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":21\">{{Cite journal |last=Möttölä |first=Kari |title=Finland and the OSCE |url=https://ifsh.de/file-CORE/documents/yearbook/english/98/Moettoelae.pdf |journal=OSCE Yearbook}}</ref>\n\nThe process was closely connected to Finland hosting significant stages of the CSCE talks, including the initial multilateral consultations and the Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Helsinki in 1972-73. This involvement gave Finland both symbolic and practical influence in shaping the European security order. For Finland, the OSCE was instrumental in maintaining its neutrality and regional stability while contributing to the broader European objective of unification through cooperation and peaceful conflict resolution.<ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":21\" />\n\nFinnish participation also served to counter Western skepticism about its neutrality and the notion of \"''[[Finlandization]]'',\" a term coined to suggest undue Soviet influence over Finnish policies. By placing Finland at the heart of a major East-West diplomatic effort, the OSCE’s consensus-driven and inclusive framework gained particular appeal for Finland as a smaller, peripheral state that pursued security through multilateral engagement rather than military alliances. Since joining, Finland has actively advocated for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law as integral components of comprehensive security within the OSCE framework.<ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":21\" />\n\n=== The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) ===\nFinland joined the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) in 1977 during a broader expansion of Bank membership to include 13 European countries between 1976 and 1977. This move was part of the IDB's strategy to strengthen economic and social development in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] by incorporating nonregional members with valuable experience, expertise, and financial resources. Finland’s membership aligned with its foreign and development policy goals, supporting initiatives aimed at reducing poverty and inequality in the region. Participation in the IDB reflects Finland’s commitment to multilateral cooperation, with development cooperation serving as a key instrument of its foreign and security policy. Through this engagement, Finland has been able to contribute to multiple IDB initiatives and foster economic relations with Latin American and Caribbean countries, thereby enhancing bilateral and multilateral development efforts since 1977.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Finland participates in capital increase of IDB Invest, an investment company operating in Latin America and the Caribbean |url=https://um.fi/press-releases/-/asset_publisher/ued5t2wDmr1C/content/suomi-osallistuu-latinalaisen-amerikan-ja-karibian-sijoitusyhtion-idb-investin-paaomakorotukseen/35732 |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Ministry for Foreign Affairs |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=IDB Invest and Finland Launch Blended Finance Climate Fund in Latin America and the Caribbean {{!}} IDB Invest |url=https://www.idbinvest.org/en/news-media/idb-invest-and-finland-launch-blended-finance-climate-fund-latin-america-and-caribbean |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=www.idbinvest.org |language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=IDB {{!}} Finland Joins NDC Pipeline Accelerator Multi-Donor Trust Fund |url=https://www.iadb.org/en/news/finland-joins-ndc-pipeline-accelerator-multi-donor-trust-fund |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=www.iadb.org |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== The African Development Bank (AfDB) ===\nFinland became a member of the [[African Development Bank]] (AfDB) in 1982, coinciding with the bank's opening of membership to non-African countries. This change was part of an amended agreement concluded at [[Lusaka]] on May 7, 1982, which allowed non-regional member countries to join the bank. The inclusion of non-African members was driven by the conviction that partnership between [[Africa|African]] and non-African countries would facilitate additional flows of international capital for economic development and social progress in Africa, benefiting all parties involved. Finland's membership reflects its commitment to supporting these development goals by contributing financial resources and expertise through the AfDB's investment projects and programs aimed at fostering economic and social development in African regional member countries. This partnership aligns with Finland's broader development cooperation objectives.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Agreement establishing the African Development Bank, as amended (with annexes and resolutions adopted by the Board of Governors on 17 May 1979 at Abidjan).

MIGA was established to promote foreign direct investment (FDI) into developing countries by providing political risk insurance and investment guarantees that shield investors from non-commercial risks such as expropriation, war, and breach of contract. The agency’s creation responded to the global need for a multilateral mechanism that could enhance investor confidence and support economic development in emerging markets through stable and fair investment conditions. By becoming a member, Finland aligned itself with international efforts to foster productive investment flows, particularly in developing economies, facilitating risk mitigation for Finnish and other investors abroad while supporting broader developmental objectives.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Finland |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2009/117431.htm |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=U.S. Department of State}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA): Overview and History |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multilateral-investment-guarantee-agency-miga.asp |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Investopedia |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency - (Intro to Political Science) - Vocab, Definition, Explanations {{!}} Fiveable |url=https://fiveable.me/key-terms/intro-to-poli-sci/multilateral-investment-guarantee-agency |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=fiveable.me |language=en}}</ref>\n\n'''The Council of Europe'''\n\nFinland joined the [[Council of Europe]] in 1989 as part of its broader strategy to affirm its commitment to European democratic values, human rights, and the rule of law. The accession was motivated by a desire to solidify Finland’s identity as a democratic state amid the [[Cold War]]’s geopolitical tensions and to participate actively in efforts to promote political stability and cooperation in Europe. Membership in the Council provided Finland with a platform to enhance dialogue and collaboration with other European countries, thereby strengthening its security and international relations as it sought closer ties with Western institutions during a period of significant political change in Europe.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite web |title=The President of the Republic of Finland: Press Releases and News |url=https://www.presidentti.fi/halonen/public/default9fe7.html |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=www.presidentti.fi}}</ref><ref name=\":23\">{{Cite web |title=Memories of autumn 1989 in Ministry for Foreign Affairs |url=https://um.fi/current-affairs/-/asset_publisher/gc654PySnjTX/content/muistikuvia-ulkoministerion-syksysta-1989 |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Ministry for Foreign Affairs |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe decision to join the Council of Europe also reflected Finland’s aspiration to integrate more fully into the European community and to have influence in shaping European governance. The timing in 1989 coincided with the waning influence of the Soviet Union and a transforming geopolitical landscape, enabling Finland to take a more assertive role in European affairs. Thus, Finland’s accession was driven by its commitment to uphold democratic principles, enhance security through European cooperation, secure a voice in European decision-making, and prepare for deeper integration within European institutions amid shifting international dynamics.<ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":23\" />\n\n=== The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) ===\nFinland joined the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD) as a founding member in 1991, aligning with the bank's mission to support the transition of former centrally planned economies in Central and Eastern Europe towards market-oriented economies after the [[Cold War]]. The establishment of the EBRD was driven by the need to foster private sector development, encourage democratic pluralism, and implement market reforms, which corresponded with Finland’s foreign policy objectives of promoting regional stability and economic transformation in the wake of the [[Soviet Union]]'s collapse.<ref name=\":24\">{{Cite web |title=European Bank for Reconstruction and Development offers opportunities for Finnish companies |url=https://finlandabroad.fi/web/gbr/current-affairs/-/asset_publisher/4ojVRXvbDRVa/content/european-bank-for-reconstruction-and-development-offers-opportunities-for-finnish-companies/384951 |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Finland abroad: United Kingdom |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":25\">{{Cite web |title=History of the EBRD |url=https://www.ebrd.com/home/who-we-are/ebrd-history.html |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=www.ebrd.com |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":26\">{{Cite web |title=Finland |url=https://www.ebrd.com/home/who-we-are/our-organisation/shareholders/finland.html |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=www.ebrd.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs a founding member, Finland contributed financially to the bank’s operations and has actively engaged in its projects, emphasizing private enterprise and sustainable, green solutions. Finnish companies and professionals have frequently participated in EBRD-financed projects, particularly in countries within the bank’s region of operation, establishing Finland’s role in supporting the economic modernization and integration of [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]]. The EBRD’s commitment to supporting multiparty democracy and market economies reflected Finland's post-Cold War foreign policy stance and enhanced its participation in European and international cooperation frameworks during a significant period of transition in Europe.<ref name=\":24\" /><ref name=\":25\" /><ref name=\":26\" />\n\nFinland’s involvement also provided opportunities for Finnish companies to engage in high-standard international projects and consultancy services, especially in emerging markets requiring transition finance and expertise.

The accession granted Finland the ability to participate in a rules-based global trading system with binding agreements that regulate international trade, providing mechanisms for trade negotiations, dispute resolution, and the reduction of trade barriers and discrimination.<ref name=\":27\">{{Cite web |title=WTO {{!}} Finland - Member information |url=https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/finland_e.htm |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=www.wto.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=WTO {{!}} The history of multilateral trading system |url=https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/history_e/history_e.htm |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=www.wto.org |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last= |date=2023-11-20 |title=Finland - Trade Agreements |url=https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/finland-trade-agreements |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=www.trade.gov |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":28\">{{Cite web |title=Trade Policy |url=https://finlandabroad.fi/web/geneve/trade-policy |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Finland abroad: Permanent Mission of Finland, Geneva |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThis membership aligned with Finland’s commitment to [[free trade]], crucial for a small country heavily reliant on international trade. Joining the WTO coincided with Finland’s accession to the [[European Union]] in 1995, which brought Finland under the EU’s trade policy framework within the WTO. As an EU member state, Finland’s participation in the WTO is coordinated through the [[European Commission]], which speaks for all EU countries in WTO trade matters. WTO membership thus facilitated Finland’s integration into the [[World economy|global economy]], underpinning its economic interests and enhancing its role in international trade through regulated multilateral cooperation.<ref name=\":27\" /><ref name=\":28\" />\n\n=== The European Union (EU) ===\nFinland joined the [[European Union]] in 1995, marking a significant turning point in the country’s history. The decision was primarily driven by the desire to strengthen Finland’s economic and political security while deepening its integration with [[Western Europe]]. After the [[Cold War]] and the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], Finland sought to diversify its trade and political relations, which had previously been closely tied to its eastern neighbor, [[Russia]]. This new phase allowed Finland to reposition itself as a Western-oriented country, thereby increasing its national prosperity and securing markets for its exports, which had been heavily reliant on the Soviet economy.<ref name=\":29\">{{Cite book |last=Elo |first=Kimmo |title=Suomi 25 vuotta Euroopan unionissa |publisher=Sigillum |year=2020}}</ref><ref name=\":30\">{{Cite web |title=Suomi Euroopan unionissa - Valtioneuvosto |url=https://valtioneuvosto.fi/suomen-eu-politiikka/suomi-euroopan-unionissa |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Valtioneuvosto |language=fi-FI}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Finland underwent a process of careful negotiation to meet the criteria for EU membership, which were solidified at the 1993 Copenhagen European Council. These criteria required new members to have stable institutions guaranteeing democracy based on the rule of law, respect for human rights including minority rights, and a functioning market economy capable of handling competitive conditions within the Union. Finland met these conditions and was thus well-prepared to join the union.<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nPolitical security also played a crucial role, as Finland sought to align itself with the Western European democracies after decades of [[Neutral country|neutrality]] during the Cold War. The country’s approach to foreign policy shifted from neutrality toward active participation in a political union, while maintaining military non-alignment. The influence of neighboring [[Sweden]], which applied for EU membership at the same time, was another important factor that encouraged Finland’s accession.<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nPublic support for EU membership was secured through a national referendum held in 1994, in which approximately 56.9% of Finnish voters favored joining the union. This referendum reflected a societal consensus that integration with the EU was essential for Finland’s future economic development and political stability. Consequently, Finland officially became a member of the European Union on January 1, 1995, embarking on a path of deeper cooperation and engagement within Europe.<ref name=\":29\" /><ref name=\":30\" />\n\n=== The Schengen Area ===\nFinland joined the [[Nordic Passport Union]] in 1954, which was a pioneering agreement among the [[Nordic countries]] to facilitate free movement of people. The Union initially abolished passport requirements for travel between [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], and [[Finland]], later extending freedom to reside and work without permits. Iceland joined the Union in 1965. Established through successive agreements in the 1950s, the Nordic Passport Union was a forerunner to the European [[Schengen Area|Schengen system]] and embodied close Nordic cooperation. It enabled citizens of member countries to travel across borders without passport controls, reinforcing shared cultural ties and economic collaboration long before broader European integration efforts.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The President of the Republic of Finland: Baltic Sea |url=https://www.presidentti.fi/halonen/public/default15f1-2.html |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=www.presidentti.fi}}</ref><ref name=\":31\">{{Cite web |date=2025-05-27 |title=Timeline of Schengen enlargement |url=https://epthinktank.eu/2025/05/28/state-of-the-schengen-area/timeline-of-schengen-enlargement/ |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Epthinktank |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThis tradition of Nordic open borders laid the groundwork for Finland's later accession to the Schengen Area, which it joined in 2001. The move was seen as a natural progression from the Nordic Passport Union towards broader European integration, eliminating internal border controls at a continental scale while enhancing security through common policies. The Schengen membership strengthened Finland's ties within the EU and continued its historical Nordic cooperation by facilitating easier movement and trade within Europe.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n=== INTELSAT ===\nFinland joined INTELSAT in 1999 as part of a long-standing national strategy to integrate into international [[telecommunications]] and space-related organizations. This membership aligned with Finland’s interests in advancing scientific research, technological development, and participation in global communications infrastructure. INTELSAT membership enabled Finland to actively engage in [[Communications satellite|satellite telecommunications]], supporting both commercial and governmental communication needs in an increasingly interconnected world.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite journal |last=Seppinen |first=Ilkka |title=Finland and the Space Era |url=https://www.esa.int/esapub/hsr/HSR_32.pdf |journal=European Space Agency}}</ref>\n\nThe path to joining INTELSAT was preceded by decades of involvement in international space and scientific organizations. Finland had gradually increased its participation in space research bodies and cooperative arrangements within European and global frameworks. These efforts were motivated by a desire to keep pace with technological advancements, benefit from technology transfer, and establish Finland’s presence in international space and telecommunications cooperation.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nJoining INTELSAT in 1999 complemented Finland’s broader foreign and technology policy goals in the 1990s, a decade marked by significant integration into international organizations such as the European Union in 1995 and active engagement in global scientific and policy forums. This step underscored Finland’s commitment to modernizing its telecommunications infrastructure and leveraging global satellite networks to enhance its communication capabilities for both civilian and government purposes.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\n==NATO== \n{{See also|Finland–NATO relations}}Finland’s relationship with [[NATO]] began to strengthen immediately after the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] in the early 1990s, when Finland joined the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council|North Atlantic Cooperation Council]] (NACC) as an observer in 1992, established for former [[Warsaw Pact]] members. Finland started to move closer to NATO by joining the [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP) program in 1994, developing cooperation in defense matters while maintaining military non-alignment. From the 1990s onwards, Finland built increasingly closer ties with NATO, participating in international crisis management operations and signing a host nation support agreement with NATO in 2014, which defined the principles of assistance during crises and exercises.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-04-17 |title=Mutkikas tie Naton luo |url=https://yle.fi/a/20-127413 |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Yle Luovat sisällöt ja media |language=fi}}</ref>\n\nFinland has participated in NATO's Partnership for Peace cooperation since 1994. Additionally, Finland became a member of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) in 1997. In 2014, Finland was invited as an advanced partner to join NATO's Enhanced Opportunities Partner (EOP) cooperation. Alongside its involvement in the Enhanced Opportunities cooperation, Finland also promoted trilateral cooperation between NATO, Finland, and Sweden, known as the \"30+2\" cooperation framework.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nato ja Suomi |url=https://um.fi/nato |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Ulkoministeriö |language=fi-FI}}</ref>\n\nAs the security environment changed, especially following [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russia’s invasion of Ukraine]] in early 2022, Finland’s security policy situation became decisive. Finland decided to apply for NATO membership in May 2022. The [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish Parliament]] strongly approved the membership, with opponents in the minority. Finland’s [[Member states of NATO|NATO membership]] came into force on April 4, 2023, making Finland a full member and part of NATO’s collective defense guarantees under Article 5.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Suomen Nato-jäsenyys -jäsenyys |url=https://um.fi/suomen-nato-jasenyys |access-date=2025-09-16 |website=Ulkoministeriö |language=fi-FI}}</ref>\n\nThis membership marked the end of Finland’s long-standing military non-alignment and strengthened Finland’s security in a changed European security landscape. Finland’s membership also enhances stability and security in the [[Baltic region|Baltic Sea region]] and [[Northern Europe]], with Finland actively participating in NATO’s collective defense and decision-making.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pekkarinen |first=Virpi |date=2025-08-26 |title=Tasavallan presidentti Alexander Stubbin puhe suurlähettiläskokouksessa Helsingissä 26.8.2025

Some 200,000 US citizens visit Finland annually, and about 3,000 US citizens are resident there. The US has an educational exchange program in Finland that is comparatively large for a Western European country of Finland's size. It is financed in part from a trust fund established in 1976 from Finland's final repayment of a US loan made in the aftermath of World War I.\n\nFinland is bordered on the east by Russia and, as one of the former Soviet Union's neighbours, has been of particular interest and importance to the US both during the [[Cold War]] and in its aftermath. Before the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, longstanding US policy was to support Finnish neutrality and to maintain and reinforce Finland's historic, cultural, and economic ties with the West. The US has welcomed Finland's increased participation since 1991 in Western economic and political structures.\n\nEconomic and trade relations between Finland and the United States are active and were bolstered by the F-18 purchase. US-Finland trade totals almost $5&nbsp;billion annually. The US receives about 7% of Finland's exports – mainly [[wood pulp]] and paper, ships, machinery, electronics and instruments and refined petroleum products<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tulli.fi/resources/tekstiversio.jsp?pageoid=24045 |title=Maatilastoja |access-date=2008-02-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120160611/http://www.tulli.fi/resources/tekstiversio.jsp?pageoid=24045 |archive-date=January 20, 2008 }}</ref> – and provides about 7% of its imports – principally computers, [[semiconductor]]s, aircraft, and machinery.\n\n* Finland has an embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]], and consulates-general in [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]].\n* United States has an embassy in Helsinki.\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Uruguay}}||{{dts|1935-03-21|format=dmy}}||See [[Finland–Uruguay relations]]\n\n* Finland's embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina accredited to Uruguay and maintains an honorary consulate in [[Montevideo]].\n* Uruguay has an embassy in Helsinki.\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Venezuela}}||{{dts|1954-03-31|format=dmy}}||\n* Finland is accredited to Venezuela from its embassy in Bogotá, Colombia.\n* Venezuela is accredited to Finland from its embassy in Oslo, Norway.\n|}\n\n==Asia==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\" \n!width=\"15%\"| Country\n!width=\"12%\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Afghanistan}}||<!-- start date --> {{dts|1956-05-11|format=dmy}}\n|\n* Afghanistan recognised the independence of Finland on July 17, 1928.\n* Afghanistan is accredited to Finland through its embassy in [[Oslo]], Norway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afghanistanembassy.no/|title=The Afghanistan Embassy – EMBASSY|website=Afghanistanembassy.no|access-date=February 19, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203065636/http://www.afghanistanembassy.no/|archive-date=February 3, 2011}}</ref>\n* Finland opened a liaison office in [[Kabul]] in 2002.

Discontent with Russian rule, Finnish national identity, and World War I eventually caused Finland to break away from Russia, taking advantage of the fact that Russia was withdrawing from World War I and a revolution was starting in earnest. Following the [[Finnish Civil War]] and [[October Revolution]], Russians were virtually equated with Communists and due to official hostility to [[Communism]], Finno-Soviet relations in the period between the world wars remained tense. Voluntary activists arranged expeditions to [[Karelia]] (''[[heimosodat]]''), which ended when Finland and the Soviet Union signed the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Finnish)|Treaty of Tartu]] in 1920. However, the Soviet Union did not abide by the treaty when they blockaded Finnish naval ships. Finland was attacked by the Soviet Union in 1939.  Finland fought the [[Winter War]] and the [[Continuation War]] against the Soviets in World War II. During the wars, the Finns suffered 90,000 casualties and inflicted severe casualties on the Russians (120,000 dead in the Winter War and 200,000 in the Continuation War).\n\nContemporary issues include problems with border controls causing persistent truck queues at the border, airspace violations, pollution of the [[Baltic Sea]], and Russian duties on exported wood to Finland's pulp and paper industry. Russia also considered large swathes of land near the Finnish border as special security area where foreign land ownership is forbidden. A similarly extensive restriction does not apply to Russian citizens.

Still, economic relations have not entirely deteriorated: 11.2% of imports to Finland are from Russia, and 5.7% of exports from Finland are to Russia, and cooperation between Finnish and Russian authorities continues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://formin.finland.fi/Public/default.aspx?nodeid=18156&contentlan=1&culture=fi-FI|title=Ulkoministeriö: Matkustaminen ja maat: Kahdenväliset suhteet|website=formin.finland.fi|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081125023048/http://formin.finland.fi/public/default.aspx?nodeid=18156&contentlan=1&culture=fi-FI|archive-date=November 25, 2008|access-date=January 9, 2018}}</ref>\n* Finland has an embassy in [[Moscow]] and a consulate-general in [[Saint Petersburg]].\n* Russia has an embassy in Helsinki, a consulate-general in [[Turku]] and consulates in [[Lappeenranta]] and [[Mariehamn]].\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Serbia}}||{{dts|1929|format=dmy}}\n|\n* Finland has an embassy in [[Belgrade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finska.co.rs/|title=Suomen suurlähetystö, Belgrad|website=Finska.co.rs|access-date=February 19, 2015}}</ref>\n* Serbia has an embassy in Helsinki.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.mfa.rs/|title=Embassy of the Republic of Serbia in the Republic of Finland|website=Helsinki.mfa.rs|access-date=February 19, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823125758/http://www.helsinki.mfa.rs/|archive-date=August 23, 2012}}</ref> \n* Finland is an [[European Union|EU]] [[Member State of the European Union|member]] and Serbia is an [[Accession of Serbia to the European Union|candidate]].\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Slovakia}}||{{dts|1993-01-01|format=dmy}}\n|[[File:Prime Minister Sanna Marin and Prime Minister of Slovakia Eduard Heger met in Helsinki 10.11.2022 05.jpg|thumb|Prime Minister Sanna Marin and Prime Minister of Slovakia [[Eduard Heger]] in 2022]]\n*Finland recognised the independence of Slovakia on January 1, 1993. \n* Finland has an embassy and an honorary consulate in [[Bratislava]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finlandembassy.sk/Public/Default.aspx|title=Suomen suurlähetystö, Bratislava|website=Finlandembassy.sk|access-date=February 19, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102093454/http://www.finlandembassy.sk/public/default.aspx|archive-date=January 2, 2015}}</ref>\n* Slovakia has an embassy in Helsinki.\n* Both countries are full members of the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]].\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Slovenia}}||{{dts|1992-02-17|format=dmy}}\n|[[File:Vrh zveze Nato v Vilni.

A newly appointed Foreign Minister makes his or her first state visit to Sweden. Finnish politicians often consider Sweden's reaction to international affairs first as a base for further actions, and thus finally both countries often agree on such issues. If there has ever been any dissonance between the two countries those were the [[Åland]] question in the early 1920s and the [[Non-belligerent|Swedish declaration of non-belligerent status]] during the [[Winter War]]. Finland and Sweden are members of the [[European Union]] and the [[Schengen agreement]], freeing international travel and trade between the countries. Furthermore, both participate in the [[Nordic Council]], which grants Swedish nationals slightly more extensive rights than the EU/Schengen treaties alone.\n* Finland has an embassy in [[Stockholm]].\n* Sweden has an embassy in Helsinki. \n* Both countries became members of the [[European Union]] on 1 January 1995. \n* Both countries applied for [[NATO]] membership on 18 May 2022.
