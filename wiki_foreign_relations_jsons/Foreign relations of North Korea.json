In the past, the country's [[foreign relations]] were marked by its conflict with [[South Korea]] and its historical ties to the [[Soviet Union]]. Both the government of North Korea and the government of South Korea claim to be the sole legitimate government of the whole of [[Korea]]. The ''[[de facto]]'' end of the [[Korean War]] left North Korea in a military confrontation with South Korea along the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]].\n\nAt the start of the [[Cold War]], North Korea had diplomatic recognition only by [[communist countries]]. Over the following decades, it established relations with developing countries and joined the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. When the [[Eastern Bloc]] collapsed in the years 1989–1992, North Korea made efforts to improve its diplomatic relations with developed capitalist countries. At the same time, there were international efforts to resolve the confrontation on the Korean peninsula (known as the [[Korean conflict]]). At the same time, North Korea [[North Korea and nuclear weapons|acquired nuclear weapons]], adding to the concerns of the [[international community]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url = http://38north.org/2017/03/wmckinney031517/ |title = Understanding North Korea's Nuclear Coercion Strategy |access-date = April 28, 2017 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170506115104/http://38north.org/2017/03/wmckinney031517/ |archive-date = May 6, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n== Principles and practice ==\nThe [[Constitution of the DPRK|Constitution of North Korea]] establishes the country's foreign policy.

Article 15 says that the country will \"protect the democratic national rights of Korean compatriots overseas and their legitimate rights and interests as recognized by international law\" and Article 17 explicates the basic ideals of the country's foreign policy:<ref name=Naenara/>\n* Basic ideals of their foreign policy are \"independence, peace and friendship\"<ref name=Naenara/>\n* Establishment of political, economic, cultural, and diplomatic relations with \"friendly countries\" on the principles of \"complete equality, independence, mutual respect, non-interference in each other's affairs and mutual benefit.\"<ref name=Naenara/>\n* Unifying with \"peoples of the world who defend their independence\"<ref name=Naenara/>\n* Actively supporting and encouraging \"struggle of all people who oppose all forms of aggression and interference and fight for their countries' independence and national and class emancipation.\"<ref name=Naenara/>\n\nOther parts of the constitution explicate other foreign policies. Article 36 says that foreign trade by the DPRK will be conducted \"by state organs, enterprises, and social, cooperative organizations\" while the country will \"develop foreign trade on the principles of complete equality and mutual benefit.\" Article 37 adds that the country will encourage \"institutions, enterprises and organizations in the country to conduct equity or contractual joint ventures with foreign corporations and individuals, and to establish and operate enterprises of various kinds in special economic zones.\" Furthermore, Article 38 says that the DPRK will implement a [[protectionist]] tariff policy \"to protect the independent national economy\" while Article 59 says the country's armed forces will \"carry out the military-first revolutionary line.\" In terms of other foreign policy, Article 80 says that the country will grant asylum to foreign nationals who have been persecuted \"for struggling for peace and democracy, national independence and socialism or for the freedom of scientific and cultural pursuits.\"<ref name=Naenara/>\n\nUltimately, however, as explicated in Articles 100–103 and 109, the chairman of the [[National Defense Commission (North Korea)|National Defense Commission]] (NDC) is the [[Supreme Leader (North Korean title)|supreme leader]] of the country, with a term that is the same as members of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] or SPA (five years),  as is established in article 90, directing the country's armed forces, and guiding overall state affairs, but is not determined by him alone since he is still accountable to the SPA.<ref name=Naenara/> Rather, the NDC chairman works to defend the state from external actors. Currently, [[Kim Jong Un]] is the [[General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea|leader of the Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK), [[President of the State Affairs Commission|head of state]], and [[Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army|supreme commander]]. The Constitution also delineates, in article 117, that the [[Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly]], which can convene the SPA, receives \"credentials and letters of recall from envoys accredited by other countries.\" Additionally, the cabinet of the DPRK has the authority to \"conclude treaties with foreign countries and conduct external affairs\" as noted in Article 125.<ref name=Naenara/>\n\nNorth Korea is one of the few countries in which the giving of presents still plays a significant role in [[diplomatic protocol]], with [[Korean Central News Agency]] (KCNA) reporting from time to time the country's leader received a floral basket or other gift from a foreign leader or organization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2004/200407/news07/08.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110162540/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2004/200407/news07/08.htm|url-status=dead|title=Past news|archivedate=January 10, 2006|website=www.kcna.co.jp}}</ref><ref>Sometimes, the announcements never mention what sort of gift, but the Kim family has [[International Friendship Exhibition|a large collection]] of cultural and other souvenirs from leaders all over the world, which is partly or entirely on public display.</ref> During a 2000 visit to Pyongyang, US Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] gave [[North Korean leader]] [[Kim Jong Il]] a [[Basketball (ball)|basketball]] signed by [[Michael Jordan]], as he took an interest in [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] basketball.<ref>{{cite news |last=Perlez |first=Jane |title=Albright reports progress in talks with north korea |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E2DB1231F936A15753C1A9669C8B63 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 25, 2000 |access-date=May 6, 2008 |archive-date=December 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221183221/https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E2DB1231F936A15753C1A9669C8B63 |url-status=live }}</ref> During the [[2000 inter-Korean summit]], Kim Jong Il made a gift of two [[Pungsan dog]]s (associated with the North) to [[South Korean president]] [[Kim Dae-jung]].

relations==\n{{Main|North Korea–South Korea relations}}\n[[File:Joint Security Area, Korean DMZ, looking south.jpg|thumb|right|The Korean DMZ, viewed from the north]]\nIn August 1971, both North and South Korea agreed to hold talks through their respective [[Red Cross]] societies with the aim of reuniting the many Korean families separated following the division of Korea after the Korean War. After a series of secret meetings, both sides announced on July 4, 1972, an agreement to work toward peaceful reunification and an end to the hostile atmosphere prevailing on the peninsula. Dialogue was renewed on several fronts in September 1984, when South Korea accepted the North's offer to provide relief goods to victims of severe flooding in South Korea.\n\nIn a major initiative in July 1988, South Korean President [[Roh Tae-woo]] called for new efforts to promote north–south exchanges, family reunification, inter-Korean trade and contact in international forums. Roh followed up this initiative in a UN General Assembly speech in which South Korea offered to discuss security matters with the North for the first time. In September 1990, the first of eight prime minister-level meetings between officials of North Korea and South Korea took place in Seoul, beginning an especially fruitful period of dialogue. The prime ministerial talks resulted in two major agreements: the [[Agreement on Reconciliation, Nonaggression, Exchanges, and Cooperation]] (the ''Basic Agreement'') and the [[Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula]] (the ''Joint Declaration''). The ''Joint Declaration'' on [[denuclearization]] was initiated on December 13, 1991. It forbade both sides to test, manufacture, produce, receive, possess, store, deploy, or use nuclear weapons and forbade the possession of nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment facilities. On January 30, 1992, North Korea also signed a nuclear safeguards agreement with the IAEA, as it had pledged to do in 1985 when acceding to the nuclear [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. This safeguards agreement allowed [[IAEA]] inspections to begin in June 1992.\n\nAs the 1990s progressed, concern over the North's nuclear program became a major issue in north–south relations and between North Korea and the US. By 1998, South Korean President [[Kim Dae-jung]] announced a [[Sunshine Policy]] towards North Korea. This led in June 2000 to the first [[Inter-Korean summit]], between Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong Il.<ref>{{cite book | title = Korea's Twentieth-Century Odyssey | url = https://archive.org/details/koreastwentieth00robi/page/165 | url-access = registration | last = Robinson | first = Michael E | year = 2007 | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | location = Honolulu | isbn = 978-0-8248-3174-5 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/koreastwentieth00robi/page/165 165, 180] }}</ref> In September 2000, the North and South Korean teams marched together at the [[Sydney Olympics]].<ref>{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |page=179}}</ref> Trade increased to the point where South Korea became North Korea's largest trading partner.<ref>{{cite book | title = Korea| last = Bluth | first = Christoph | year = 2008| publisher = Polity Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 978-07456-3357-2 |page=107}}</ref> Starting in 1998, the [[Mount Kumgang Tourist Region]] was developed as a joint venture between the government of North Korea and [[Hyundai Group|Hyundai]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Korea's Twentieth-Century Odyssey | url = https://archive.org/details/koreastwentieth00robi/page/179 | url-access = registration | last = Robinson | first = Michael E | year = 2007 | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | location = Honolulu | isbn = 978-0-8248-3174-5 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/koreastwentieth00robi/page/179 179–80] }}</ref> In 2003, the [[Kaesong Industrial Region]] was established to allow South Korean businesses to invest in the North.<ref>{{cite book | title = Korea| last = Bluth | first = Christoph | year = 2008| publisher = Polity Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 978-07456-3357-2 |pages=107–08}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, South Korean President [[Roh Moo-hyun]] held talks with Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7023079.stm Korean leaders in historic talks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016062235/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7023079.stm |date=October 16, 2007 }}, BBC, Tuesday, October 2, 2007, 10:14 GMT</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/7023270.stm In pictures: Historic crossing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307181107/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/7023270.stm |date=March 7, 2008 }}, BBC, October 2, 2007, 10:15 GMT</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7022080.stm Mixed feelings over Koreas summit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115122230/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7022080.stm |date=November 15, 2007 }}, BBC, October 2, 2007, 10:17 GMT</ref><ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/10/01/koreas.summit/index.html Kim greets Roh in Pyongyang before historic summit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109070221/http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/10/01/koreas.summit/index.html |date=November 9, 2007 }}, CNN.

In the 1980s an indigenous nuclear reactor development program started with a small experimental 5&nbsp;MWe [[gas-cooled reactor]] in Yongbyon, with a 50&nbsp;MWe and 200&nbsp;MWe reactor to follow. Concerns that North Korea had non-civilian nuclear ambitions were first raised in the late 1980s and almost resulted in their withdrawal from the NPT in 1994. However, the [[Agreed Framework]] and the [[Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization]] (KEDO) temporarily resolved this crisis by having the US and several other countries agree that in exchange for dismantling its nuclear program, two light-water reactors (LWRs) would be provided with moves toward normalization of political and economic relations. This agreement started to break down from 2001 because of slow progress on the KEDO light water reactor project and [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Axis of Evil]] speech. After continued allegations from the United States, North Korea declared the existence of [[uranium enrichment]] programs during a private meeting with American military officials. North Korea withdrew from the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] on January 10, 2003.
