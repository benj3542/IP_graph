"{{Short description|none}} <!-- \"none\" is preferred when the title is sufficiently descriptive; see [[WP:SDNONE]] -->\n{{Politics of Algeria}}\nSince its independence from France in 1962, [[Algeria]] has pursued an activist foreign policy. In the 1960s and 1970s, [[Algeria]] was noted for its support of [[Third World]] policies and independence movements. Since its independence, Algeria has been a member of the [[Arab League]], the [[African Union]] and of the [[United Nations]].\n\n== History of foreign relations since independence ==\n\n=== During Ben Bella's presidency (1962–1965) ===\nFollowing its independence in 1962, Algeria developed deep ties with many foreign countries with a heavy presence in the global scene. The Algerian government, pursuing the dynamics that had started during the Algerian War for Independence and into the [[Cold War]] used the country's strategic geopolitical position – at the crossroads of Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian world – to assert its own interests. Algeria came to see itself as a full actor in the Cold War and not simply a bystander caught in a crossfire between the Western and Eastern blocs. Moreover, Algeria played a central role in the creation of the [[Third World]] as a global political project, using its position at the intersection of international agendas – notably between non-alignment and Afro-Asianism positions, and between [[Anti-imperialism|anticolonial]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] movements.\n\n==== Algeria at the center of the competition between the Western and Eastern superpowers ====\nBeing a newly independent country from colonial rule of a Western power – France – and having waged a liberation war with a socialist orientation, Algeria was naturally inclined to turn towards the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies. However, the country's strategic advantages increased its importance to the eyes of the Western bloc. Primarily, [[France]] wanted to preserve its interests in the oil and gas exploitations in Algeria. As [[Charles de Gaulle]] stated to the Algerian finance minister in 1963, \"If the Algerian government respects its commitments and takes into account our interests, it can count on our cooperation\". Hence, French economic aid continued to flow in Algeria, to ensure control on the petroleum and gas industry as well as maintain  continued use of Algerian soil to run [[Nuclear weapons testing|atomic tests in the Saharan desert]]. Under [[Ahmed Ben Bella|Ben Bella]], diplomatic relations with France were normalized, the negotiations concerning oil and gas leading to an agreement in 1964. As to the [[United States]], they wanted to prevent Algeria from becoming yet another socialist country joining the ranks of the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc]]. Hence, along with minor military equipment, the United States provided Algeria with a food program (PL-480) which delivered free food to the population. However, the Algerian commitment to supporting anti-colonial movements in Africa went against American interests in  the continent, which led to an indirect conflict with the United States and an increasingly hostile relationship between the two countries.\n\nDuring the war for independence, the [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)|ALN]] had already benefitted from equipment, training and advice from communist countries: the USSR (though its help was quite timid until the final months of the war), [[China]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. Moreover, [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)|ALN]] delegations had visited China and [[North Vietnam]] to learn from their [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] strategies. Help and support from the communist bloc therefore increased after independence:\n\n* Even though Algeria was not a communist regime, the [[Soviet Union]] invested massive amounts of money and material help in the country. For instance, in 1963, the USSR granted $200 million in import credits for Soviet machinery to help build the Algerian industry, and committed to building a petrochemical research institute. The Soviet Union also agreed to buy agricultural products and minerals that Algeria was struggling to export. It was finally the country's main military supplier, providing planes, tanks, armored vehicles, ships, light weapons and ammunition for a total of 11 billion dollars from 1962 to 1989.\n* The other great communist power, [[China]], demonstrated its interest in Algeria as a fellow antiimperialist country. Hence, when [[Zhou Enlai]] visited Algeria in December 1963, he granted Algeria a low-interest loan of $100 million. Moreover, the Chinese were more aggressive in their support for armed groups fighting imperialist and neo-imperialist regimes in Africa. Algeria and China therefore cooperated on this matter, with China contributing to ANP training camps, and shipping weapons and revolutionary militants to Algeria.\n\nThe [[Sino-Soviet split]] strengthened the two communist countries' competition for Algeria. However, China was inferior economically and militarily to the USSR, and could not match the USSR's industrial equipment and sophisticated armaments. Moreover, as the autogestion model proved to be widely inefficient, Algeria started to move towards a more centralized and Soviet-style economy by the end of 1964.\n\n==== Algeria and the Third World project ====\nBen Bella's foreign policy was marked by globalism, as it was not restrained to a specific culture nor geographical region. Rather, the project of the [[Third-Worldism|Third World]] and its diverse manifestations – the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], the [[Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organisation|Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization]], etc. – were meant to include all the developing and anti-imperialist countries, and Algeria intended to play a major role in its development.\n\nThis role is perfectly summarized by [[Amílcar Cabral|Amilcar Cabral]]'s – leader of the [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] – famous declaration that Algeria was the \"Mecca of revolution\". Indeed, the Algerian foreign policy had been influenced by [[Frantz Fanon]]'s and other radical Third World thinkers' urgings to \"export revolution\" to other countries suffering from the yoke of imperial oppression. Therefore, the support of armed nationalists and revolutionaries was one of the foundations of Algerian relations with African countries. Ever since 1960, the FLN camps in Algeria's neighboring countries ([[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Mali]]) had been used to provide training and material help to revolutionary movements. By 1963, Algeria was offering refuge, funds, weapons and training to rebels from a dozen African countries: the left-wing opposition in Morocco, the secessionist Sanwi government in Ivory Coast, the [[Sawaba|Sawaba party]] in Niger, the CNL (or \"Simbas\") in [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Congo-Leopoldville]], the [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon|UPC]] in Cameroon, the [[MPLA]] and [[National Liberation Front of Angola|FNLA]] in Angola (250 recruits were trained in Algeria and 70 tons of armaments were sent to this country), and several armed groups in Zanzibar, Portuguese Guinea, South Africa and Namibia.\n\nHowever, the [[Third-Worldism|Third World]] project also materialized through the various conferences and international organizations that united developing countries. Firstly, the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], which was founded in Belgrade in 1961, and which Algeria joined shortly after its independence, defined the concept of non-alignment in the Cold War as a way for poor countries to exploit the conflicts and tensions and hence to promote their own interests. According to Jeffrey J. Byrne, the Algerian conception of the Non-Aligned Movement was that of a \"political, goal-oriented and geographically unbounded anti-imperial solidarity\". The Third World coalition could therefore encompass Latin America countries, and even Europe ones like [[Yugoslavia]]. Algeria was particularly important in this sense, as it acted as a bridge between blocs and regions. For instance, its position at the crossroads of the Arab and the sub-Saharan worlds enabled Algeria to create links and unity between these two regions: at Algeria's request, Arab countries supported Angolan and other African revolutions, while African countries endorsed the Palestinian cause. However, these global Third World solidarity links went further than Africa: for example, the [[Viet Cong|National Liberation Front of South Vietnam]] opened a permanent office in Algiers (one of only two that were located in non-communist countries). One of the most successful Third World projects was the [[Organisation of African Unity|Organization of African Unity]], founded in Addis Ababa in 1963 to formalize and institutionalize the main Third World principles. Moreover, Algeria advocated for the creation within the organization of a \"liberation committee\", the \"Committee of Nine\", to support national liberation movements (even by military means). This embodies the Algerian view of Third Worldism: the institutionalization of collective defiance towards the imperial system.\n\nTherefore, if the multipolarity of international relations – the traditional East versus West bipolarism, but also the intra-communist poles and the development of Third World alternatives – had benefitted the non-aligned states such as Algeria, the latter's increasing reliance on the Soviet Union – especially since the [[Sand War]] against Morocco in 1963 – risked jeopardizing the country's independence and its relations with other powers, such as the United States or China.\n\n=== During Boumediene's presidency (1965–1978) ===\nAlgerian foreign relations during the presidency of [[Houari Boumédiène|Houari Boumediene]] marked a shift towards more stable and Algero-centered policies, in opposition to [[Ahmed Ben Bella|Ben Bella]]'s cosmopolitism. However, this greater focus on the country's economic needs and traditional Islamic culture did not end the period of international ambitions.\n\n==== Algeria's centrality in the Third World ====\n[[Pan-Africanism]] and [[Pan-Arabism]] were strengthened during the Boumediene era. Algeria had joined the [[Arab League]] in 1962, and hosted its 1973 summit in Algiers. This strong relation with other Arab countries, notably with [[Egypt]], was reinforced after Boumediene's seizure of power. For instance, in 1966, Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] sent thousands of teachers to support Algeria in the Arabization of its educational system. After Nasser's death in 1970, Boumediene increasingly represented the political project of Pan-Arabism; and in 1973, Algeria played a major role in the organization of the war against [[Israel]], as well as calling for oil to be used as a weapon in the [[OPEC]]. Moreover, in 1969, Algiers hosted the Pan-African Cultural Festival: this grandiose display of an African identity, forged from the continent's common experience of Western imperialism, reunited anticolonial militants from numerous countries of the Third World. Far from being opposed, Pan-Arabism and Pan-Africanism were, under Algerian influence, united: Boumediène summoned an extraordinary session of the Organization for African Unity following the [[Yom Kippur War|Kippur War]] in 1973, which resulted in the creation of a special committee to coordinate the Organization and the Arab League, and in the break of diplomatic relations of 42 African states with Israel. Finally, Boumediène presided over a larger and more powerful Non-Aligned Movement in 1973.\n\nAlgeria's approach to international politics was motivated by the need for a \"liberation\" from the Western neocolonial economic superiority. Hence, in October 1967, Algiers hosted the meeting of the \"[[Group of 77]]\", which united 77 developing countries on major revendications: a global reform of the terms of trade and a greater collaboration between Third World countries to set the prices for their raw materials. Furthermore, the main points of Boumediene's address to the United Nations General Assembly in 1974 – reparations for colonization and a transfer of resources from North to South – were adopted by UN. The notion of a \"new international economic order\" emerged as a way to reshape the world economy to the benefit of developing countries, based on the principle of sovereign equality between states.\n\n==== A careful equilibrium between Cold War powers ====\nBoumediene took pride in Algeria's non-aligned status, by claiming its distance from both Soviet-style socialism and Western capitalism, while the country enjoyed an increasing prosperity. However, support from the Communist bloc did not halt. Indeed, because of their dependence on raw materials and their lack of hard currencies, commerce between Third World countries was negligible. The USSR, on the contrary, was able to deliver military equipment, industrial expertise, and trade outputs: the Soviets replaced France as the first destination for Algerian wine, and provided 200,000 tons of wheat when a drought hit the country in 1966.\n\nOnce again, the support Algeria received from the Soviet bloc was not exclusive to that of the Western bloc. Even though Boumediene took strong public stands, as when he claimed in 1969 after a summer of violence against Algerians living in France that if the French government could not insure the security of Algerian immigrants, he would repatriate them regardless of the cost, [[Algeria–France relations|Algerian-French relations]] were progressively normalized during the 1970 decade. This posturing, like the nationalization of oil in 1971, served to increase his popularity in internal politics. However, France remained a model of prosperity, Algeria was still heavily dependent on France economically, and in 1975, French President [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] made the first presidential visit since independence. More generally, Algeria continued to do business with the West, and avoided to be overly dependent on Soviet support. Indeed, despite the break of relations with the United States after the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, the Americans had almost replaced France as Algeria's primary trade partner by the early 1970s. Therefore, the competition between the West and the USSR gave Algeria opportunities to diversify its economic partnerships.\n\n=== During Bouteflika's presidency (1999 - 2019) ===\nSince his inauguration in 1999, President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] sought to extend Algeria's international influence, traveling extensively throughout the world. In July 2001, he became the first Algerian President to visit the [[US White House]] in 16 years.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Allen |first1=Mike |title=Bush Meets With Algerian President |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/11/06/bush-meets-with-algerian-president/435a2ccc-3345-4b4c-a06e-c328e7faf077/ |newspaper=Washington Post |date=6 November 2001}}</ref>\n\nHe made official visits, among others, to [[France]], [[South Africa]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and [[Russia]].\n\n=== After Bouteflika (2019-) ===\n\nOn 24 August 2021, Algeria cut diplomatic relations with neighbouring Morocco, accusing Morocco of supporting a separatist group and hostile actions against Algeria.

The national integrity of this former colonial territory has caused a deep-seated antagonism and general mistrust between the two nations that has permeated all aspects of Moroccan-Algerian relations.  Algeria's interest in the region dates back to the 1960s and 1970s when it joined Morocco, Mauritania & [[Libya]] in efforts to remove the Spanish from the territory. After [[Spain]] announced its intention to abandon the province, then known as [[Spanish Sahara]], in 1975, the united front presented by the [[Maghreb]] nations quickly disintegrated, as a result of Morocco, and subsequently [[Mauritania]], staking claims to the territory. Algeria, although not asserting any territorial ambitions of its own, was averse to the absorption of the territory by any of its neighbors and called for self-determination for the [[Saharawi people]]. Before the Spanish evacuation, Spain, Morocco, and Mauritania agreed to divide the territory and transfer the major part to Morocco and the remaining southern portion to Mauritania. This agreement violated a [[United Nations]] (UN) resolution that declared all historical claims on the part of Mauritania or Morocco to be insufficient to justify territorial absorption and drew heavy Algerian criticism.<ref name=\"cs\"/>\n* Algeria has an embassy in [[Rabat]], a consulate-general in [[Casablanca]] and a consulate in [[Oujda]].\n* Morocco has an embassy in Algiers and consulates-general in [[Oran]] and [[Sidi Bel Abbès]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Niger}}||12 March 1965||Both countries established diplomatic relations on 12 March 1965 when the government of Niger has agreed to the nomination of M.

Contending that the [[Sahrawis]] have a right to self-determination under the [[UN Charter]], Algeria has provided the Polisario with material, financial, and political support and sanctuary in southwestern Algeria's [[Tindouf Province]].

Indeed, despite their geographical distance, the two countries saw themselves as the models of a successful socialist revolution against imperialist forces. Moreover, they more pragmatically believed that to defend themselves from [[United States|American]] hostility, they ought to encourage revolutions elsewhere in Latin America and in Africa as to distract the United States and create new allies. Hence, guerrilla hero [[Che Guevara|Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara]] visited Algeria twice, from October 1963 to February 1964, and in February 1965, and [[Fidel Castro|Cuban President Fidel Castro]] made a grand official visit to Algeria in 1972. Cuba also sent large quantities of military equipment (two ships, a unity of tanks and 700 soldiers) to Algeria in 1963 during the [[Sand War|Sand War with Morocco]]. Indeed, once again, Algeria was a point of contact between African rebels and potential supporting countries such as Cuba. This relationship was mutually beneficial: Algeria received Argentinian training guerrilleros, a delegation of the Venezuelan National Liberation Front, and even sent armaments to the latter (in an Algerian ship, as to avoid American control) at Cuba's request.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |last1=byrne |first1=jeffrey james |title=Our Own Special Brand of Socialism: Algeria and the Contest of Modernities in the 1960s |journal=Diplomatic History |date=June 2009 |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=427–447 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7709.2009.00779.x}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Mecca of revolution : Algeria, decolonization, and the Third World order|last=Byrne|first=Jeffrey James|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016}}</ref> \n* Algeria has an embassy in [[Havana]].\n* Cuba has an embassy in Algiers.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Mexico}}||21 October 1964||See [[Algeria–Mexico relations]]\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 21 October 1964<ref>{{Cite web |title=Panorama de las relaciones bilaterales |url=https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/argelia/index.php/acerca-de-la-embajada/embajada#:~:text=M%C3%A9xico%20y%20Argelia%20establecieron%20relaciones,Argel%20fue%20Ernesto%20Madero%20V%C3%A1zquez. |access-date=8 May 2023 |website=embamex.sre.gob.mx |language=es}}</ref>\n* Algeria has an embassy in [[Mexico City]].<ref>[https://www.inm.gob.mx/gobmx/word/index.php/argelia/ Embassy of Algeria in Mexico City]</ref>\n* Mexico has an embassy in Algiers.<ref>[https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/argelia/ Embassy of Mexico in Algiers]</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Peru}}||10 March 1972||Both countries established diplomatic relations on 10 March 1972.<ref>{{Cite web |date=10 March 2022 |title=50° Aniversario del establecimiento de Relaciones Diplomáticas entre el Perú y Argelia |url=https://www.gob.pe/institucion/rree/noticias/589223-50-aniversario-del-establecimiento-de-relaciones-diplomaticas-entre-el-peru-y-argelia |access-date=24 September 2023 |website=gob.pe |language=es}}</ref>{{main|Algeria–Peru relations}}\n\n* Algeria has an embassy in [[Lima]].\n* Peru has an embassy in Algiers.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|United States}}||29 September 1962||See [[Algeria–United States relations]]\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 29 September 1962<ref>{{Cite web |title=A Guide to the United States' History of Recognition, Diplomatic, and Consular Relations, by Country, since 1776: Algeria |url=https://history.state.gov/countries/algeria |access-date=1 December 2023 |website=Office of The Historian}}</ref>\n\nMilitary cooperation between the United States and Algeria were less sensible than that with the Soviet Union, and Algerian purchases in the early years of independence were mostly restrained to American planes. However, the intermediary role played by Algeria during the [[Iran hostage crisis|Iranian hostage crisis]] generated the purchase of general military equipment in 1985 through the [[Foreign Military Sales]] program.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Mokhefi|first=Mansouria|date=2015|title=Alger-Moscou : évolution et limites d'une relation privilégiée|journal=Politique étrangère|volume= automne, no. 3|issue=3|pages=57–70|doi=10.3917/pe.153.0057|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nEven though the United States were initially positively inclined to develop strong diplomatic links with the newly independent Algerian state, their relations declined rapidly. Indeed, the Algerian official declarations against American interventionism in Africa and as far as [[North Vietnam]], and their support to left-wing revolutionary groups against American-supported regimes (notably in [[Angola]], but also in Latin America through their close connections with [[Cuba]]) increased the hostility against Algeria in American opinion. The United States feared that Algeria was more favorable to the communist bloc and risked threatening their interests. Moreover, the Algerians resented the American failure to deliver the kind of assistance they requested: although the PL-480 food program provided food to millions of Algerians, the government sought to develop its economy through wider and long-term industrial programs. As Foreign Affairs Minister [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika|Bouteflika]] stated in 1965, \"The US gives us bread; what we need is work. We need factories that create things and give work to our people\". However, despite the break of diplomatic relations with the United States in 1967 following the [[Six-Day War]], their economic exchanges did not stop. Indeed, the United States had nearly replaced France as Algeria's first trade partner by the beginning of the 1970s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn July 2001, President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] became the first [[President of Algeria|Algerian President]] to visit the [[White House]] since 1985.  This visit, followed by a second meeting in November 2001, a meeting in New York in September 2003, and President Bouteflika's participation at the June 2004 [[30th G8 summit|G8 Sea Island Summit]], is indicative of the growing relationship between the [[United States]] and [[Algeria]].  Since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States, contacts in key areas of mutual concern, including law enforcement and [[counter-terrorism]] cooperation, have intensified. Algeria publicly condemned the terrorist attacks on the United States and has been strongly supportive of the international [[War on Terrorism|war against terrorism]]. The United States and Algeria consult closely on key international and regional issues. The pace and scope of senior-level visits has accelerated.

More than 1 million Algerians resided in France and there were numerous francophones in Algeria, creating a tremendous cultural overlap. French remained the language of instruction in most schools and the language used in more than two-thirds of all newspapers and periodicals and on numerous television programs. Algeria and France share a cultural background that transcends diplomatic maneuvers and has persisted throughout periods of \"disenchantment\" and strained relations. Over time, however, the arabization of Algeria and the increasing polarization of society between the francophone elite and the Arab masses have mobilized anti-French sentiment. Support for the arabization of Algerian society—including the elimination of French as the second national language and emphasis on an arabized education curriculum—and the recent success of the FIS indicate a growing fervor in Algeria for asserting an independent national identity. Such an identity emphasizes its Arab and Islamic cultural tradition rather than its French colonial past.  However, France's support for the military regime that assumed power in early 1992 indicates that the cooperative relations between the two countries remain strong.<ref name=\"cs\" />\n* Algeria has an embassy in [[Paris]] and several consulates-general throughout the country.\n* France has an embassy in Algiers and consulates-general in [[Annaba]] and [[Oran]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Germany}}||1 October 1962||\nSee [[Algeria–Germany relations]]\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 1 October 1962.<ref>{{Cite journal |author1=Jean-François Juilliard |author2=Françoise Moussu |title=Chronologie des faits internationaux d'ordre juridique.

Indeed, the Yugoslavian economic system constituted a model for the Algerian-style autogestion experimented in the early Ben Bella years. Henceforth, the Yugoslavian government sent technical advisers and agricultural material to Algeria. Moreover, Yugoslavia and Algeria shared similar views on international matters, such as the necessity for the extension of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Indeed, [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] saw in Algeria a way to legitimate the possibility of diversity in [[socialism]], rather than the imposed and monolithic [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-model. Their alliance was also geopolitically strategic: Algeria constituted a gate into the African and Arab worlds for Yugoslavia, who intended to create stronger links with this continent. Therefore, while Yugoslavia benefited from Algerian close relations with African countries, Algeria could use Yugoslavian greater military and logistical resources to pursue its program of exporting revolution in the continent.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Byrne |first1=Jeffrey James |title=Beyond Continents, Colours, and the Cold War: Yugoslavia, Algeria, and the Struggle for Non-Alignment |journal=The International History Review |date=10 June 2015 |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=912–932 |doi=10.1080/07075332.2015.1051569|s2cid=154033045 }}</ref>\n\n* Algeria has an embassy in [[Belgrade]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.rs/Embassies/alzir/alzirs_e.html |title=Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: direction of the Algerian embassy in Belgrade |access-date=2009-05-20 |archive-date=2009-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503193338/http://www.mfa.gov.rs/Embassies/alzir/alzirs_e.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* Serbia has an embassy in Algiers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ambserbie-alger.com/ |title=Serbian embassy in Algiers (in French and Serbian only) |access-date=2009-05-20 |archive-date=2009-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223201224/http://www.ambserbie-alger.com/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [http://www.mfa.gov.rs/Policy/Bilaterala/Algeria/index_e.html Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about bilateral relations with Algeria] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519070554/http://mfa.gov.rs/Policy/Bilaterala/Algeria/index_e.html |date=2011-05-19 }}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Spain}}||18 December  1962||See [[Algeria–Spain relations]]\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 18 December 1962.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Relaciones diplomáticas del Estado Espaniol |url=https://www.raco.cat/index.php/AnuarioCIDOB/article/download/33281/85107/ |access-date=4 October 2023 |page=307 |language=es}}</ref>\n\n* Algeria has an embassy in [[Madrid]] and consulates-general in [[Alicante]] and [[Barcelona]].\n* Spain has an embassy in Algiers and a consulate-general in [[Oran]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Ukraine}}||20 August 1992||See [[Algeria–Ukraine relations]]\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 20 August 1992.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Middle East and Africa: Algeria |url=https://mfa.gov.ua/en/about-ukraine/bilateral-cooperation/middle-east-and-africa |access-date=30 November 2023 |website=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine}}</ref>\n* Algeria has an embassy in [[Kyiv]].\n* Ukraine has an embassy in Algiers.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{#invoke:flag||United Kingdom}}||{{Date table sorting|1962}}||See [[Algeria–United Kingdom relations]]\n[[File:David Cameron is met by PM Sellal of Algeria (8431378795).jpg|thumb|right|[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] with [[Prime Minister of Algeria|Algerian Prime Minister]] [[Abdelmalek Sellal]] in Algeria, January 2013.]]\nAlgeria established [[Foreign relations of the United Kingdom|diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom]] on 16 November 1962.<ref name=\"britain\"/>{{failed verification|reason=The source does not state when Algeria and the United Kingdom established diplomatic relations.|date=June 2025}}\n*Algeria maintains an [[Embassy of Algeria, London|embassy]] in [[London]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Diplomat Magazine|date=2 November 2016|url=https://diplomatmagazine.com/heads-of-mission/africa/algeria/|title=Algeria|website=Diplomat Magazine|access-date=10 June 2025|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250513004149/https://diplomatmagazine.com/heads-of-mission/africa/algeria/|archive-date=13 May 2025|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* The United Kingdom is accredited to Algeria through its embassy in Algiers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-algiers|title=British Embassy Algiers|website=[[gov.uk|GOV.UK]]|access-date=10 June 2025|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250609111404/https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-algiers|archive-date=9 June 2025|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoth countries share common membership of the [[United Nations]].
