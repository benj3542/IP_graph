Serbia has established full diplomatic relations with most world nations – 189 UN member states and 2 non-member observer state, most recently [[Foreign relations of the Marshall Islands|with the Marshall Islands]] in 2024. \n\nSerbia is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[International Criminal Court]], the [[Council of Europe]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], the [[Central European Initiative]], the [[Central European Free Trade Agreement]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank Group]], the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], the [[World Customs Organization]], the [[Interpol]], the [[International Organization for Standardization]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]], the [[International Olympic Committee]], and other international organizations.\n\n==History==\n===Medieval Serbia===\nMedieval Serbia’s foreign policy evolved from defensive autonomy under the [[Vlastimirović dynasty]] to ambitious expansion under the [[Nemanjić dynasty]] kingdom, and finally to desperate survival under the [[Serbian Despotate]]. Serbia balanced relations with [[Byzantine Empire]], Bulgaria, [[Kingdom of Hungary]], [[Republic of Venice]], and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], using alliances, marriages, and Orthodoxy to assert influence.{{sfn|Коматина|2014|p=7-22}} While achieving a brief [[Serbian Empire|imperial peak]] under [[Stefan Dušan]], Serbia’s fragmentation and the Ottoman rise led to its eventual subjugation. Its foreign policy was marked by pragmatism, adaptability, and a persistent drive to unite Serb lands, leaving a lasting cultural and political legacy in the Balkans.\n\n===Principality of Serbia===\nSerbia gained its autonomy from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Serbian Revolution]] (1804–1817), although Ottoman troops continued to garrison the capital, Belgrade, until 1867. \n\nThe Principality of Serbia’s foreign relations were defined by its quest for independence from the Ottoman Empire, reliance on Russian support, and cautious navigation of Austrian influence. Serbia cultivated alliances with [[Principality of Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Greece]], while relations with [[Bulgaria]] turned competitive. The [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] (later [[Austria-Hungary]]), and [[Russian Empire]], shaped Serbia’s options, with the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]] granting independence but limiting territorial gains. Serbia’s diplomacy balanced nationalist aspirations with pragmatic cooperation, laying the groundwork for its later role as a Balkans power.<ref>Lawrence P. Meriage, \"The First Serbian Uprising (1804-13) and the Nineteenth-Century Origins of the Eastern Question.\" ''Slavic Review'' (1978) 37#3 pp 421-439.</ref> \n\nSerbia explored alliances with other Balkan states to counter Ottoman and Austrian influence, however, its small size and economic dependence limited its diplomatic leverage. \n\n===Kingdom of Serbia===\nIn 1882, Serbia was proclaimed a kingdom under King Milan I of the [[House of Obrenović]], later succeeded by the [[House of Karađorđević]]. \n\nThe Kingdom of Serbia’s foreign relations was driven by its quest for territorial expansion and South Slavic unification. Serbia aimed to unite South Slavic territories, particularly those with Serb populations, under the concept of \"[[Greater Serbia]]\" or South Slavic unity ([[Yugoslavism]]). This ambition often put it at odds with the Ottoman Empire and Austria, which controlled Serb-populated regions like Bosnia and Vojvodina.<ref>Martin Gilbert,  ''First World War Atlas'' (1970) p 8.</ref><ref>Richard C. Hall, \"Serbia,\" in Richard F. Hamilton, and Holger H. Herwig, eds. The Origins of World War I (Cambridge UP, 2003) pp 92–111.</ref><ref>Christopher Clark, ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914'' (2012) pp 3–64 [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780061146657 online].</ref> \n\nIn the [[First Balkan War]], Serbia, alongside Greece, Bulgaria, and Montenegro, defeated the Ottoman Empire, gaining Kosovo and parts of Macedonia. The [[Second Balkan War]] against Bulgaria secured further territorial gains but deepened regional rivalry with Bulgaria. \n\nAustria-Hungary's annexation of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1908 deeply alienated Serbia. A trade dispute with Austria-Hungary, which imposed a customs blockade to pressure Serbia economically, highlighted Serbia’s dependence on external markets. Serbia countered by diversifying trade with France and Britain, strengthening Western ties. Russia, a fellow Slavic and Orthodox Christian state, provided diplomatic and military support, viewing Serbia as a counterweight to Austria-Hungary in the Balkans. Russia’s support was crucial during the July Crisis of 1914, when Serbia faced Austria-Hungary’s ultimatum after the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]].\n\nSerbia’s foreign policy was tested by Austria-Hungary’s invasion following the Sarajevo assassination. Serbia’s resistance, supported by Russia and France, led to initial victories but eventual occupation by 1915. Serbia’s government-in-exile in Corfu maintained diplomatic efforts, culminating in the 1918 creation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] (initially Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes), achieving Serbian main goal of South Slavic unification.<ref>Gale Stokes, \"The Serbian Documents from 1914: A Preview\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 48#3 (1976), pp. 69-84 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1878810 online]</ref>\n\n===Yugoslavia===\n{{main|Foreign relations of Yugoslavia}}\n\n===Yugoslav Wars and international isolation===\nDuring the 1990s, Serbia was part of the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], comprising Serbia and Montenegro, formed in 1992 after the breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The foreign policy, dominated by Serbia under President [[Slobodan Milošević]], was heavily influenced by the [[Yugoslav Wars]] and [[International sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro|international isolation]].\n\nSerbia provided support to Serb forces in Serb-populated areas across the former Yugoslavia, though it officially denied direct military involvement until the Kosovo War. This led to involvement in conflicts in [[Croatian War of Independence|Croatia]] (1991–1995), [[Bosnian War|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (1992–1995), and [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]] (1998–1999). These actions strained relations with the international community and thus country faced severe international sanctions. This isolation was marked by ruptured diplomatic relations, and exclusion from international organizations (such as the UN, OSCE, and the Council of Europe) as well blocked access to international financial institutions (the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[World Bank]]), profoundly shaping Serbia’s foreign policy and global standing. The FR Yugoslavia was barred from the UN General Assembly in 1992, with its claim to be the sole successor to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia rejected. Instead, the UN declared the SFR Yugoslavia dissolved.<ref>https://www.clintonlibrary.gov/research/dissolution-yugoslavia-topic-guide {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2025}}</ref>\n\nRelations with Western countries, particularly the United States and key European nations, deteriorated sharply, culminating in the closure of the United States embassy in Belgrade in 1999 before NATO’s bombing campaign. The 1999 NATO bombing campaign, led by the United States, marked a low point, with the U.S. embassy remaining closed until 2001, reflecting a near-total suspension of formal diplomatic ties.\nRelations with Western countries, particularly the United States and key European nations, deteriorated sharply resulting in severing or reducing diplomatic presence in Belgrade. Germany, a key supporter of Croatian and Bosnian independence, recalled its ambassador in 1992, maintaining only minimal consular functions throughout the 1990s. The United Kingdom and France followed suit, with embassies operating at reduced capacity or closing during the Kosovo War. The [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|1999 NATO bombing campaign]], marked a low point: the United States closed [[Embassy of the United States, Belgrade|its embassy in Belgrade]], reflecting a near-total suspension of formal diplomatic ties.\n\nFacing Western ostracism, country sought support from traditional allies like [[Russia–Serbia relations|Russia]] and [[Greece–Serbia relations|Greece]]. Russia provided diplomatic backing, vetoing harsher UN measures and maintaining an embassy in Belgrade, though its support was constrained by Russia’s own post-Soviet challenges. Greece, despite EU membership, maintained relatively warm relations due to cultural and Orthodox ties, serving as a diplomatic bridge to the West. China also opposed NATO’s actions, particularly after the 1999 bombing of its Belgrade embassy, but its support was largely rhetorical. The Non-Aligned Movement, once a cornerstone of the Socialist Yugoslavia foreign policy, offered little practical support, as many member states aligned with the key western countries or remained neutral to avoid entanglement in the Yugoslav conflicts.\n\n===Democratic transition===\nIn the 2000s, Serbia's foreign policy has shifted dramatically from isolation to reintegration, with a focus on restoring and expanding diplomatic ties with Western countries. The [[Overthrow of Slobodan Milošević|overthrow of Milošević]] in 2000 marked a turning point, shifting from isolation to reintegration to the international community. Country was re-admitted to the United Nations as a new member soon thereafter while rejoining also the UN, OSCE and the Council of Europe as well as secured IMF and World Bank membership.<ref>https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/3/f/16605.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=August 2025}}</ref> Relations with Western nations began to thaw. Key EU states, including Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, reestablished full diplomatic relations, with embassies resuming normal operations. Germany, in particular, emerged as a key partner, investing heavily in Serbia’s economy. The [[Serbia–United States relations|relations with the United States]] were also restored with full diplomatic relations. The [[European Union]] became Serbia's primary diplomatic focus, with the [[Stabilisation and Association Process|Stabilization and Association Agreement]] in 2008 and [[Potential enlargement of the European Union|candidacy status]] in 2012 marking key milestones. \n\n[[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum|Montenegro’s independence]] in 2006 resulted in restoring Serbia as an independent nation after 88 years, with country being the sole successor state of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro.\n\n===Contemporary period===\nSerbia since early 2010s have been pursuing a multi-vector foreign policy, balancing relations with the European Union, the United States, Russia, and China.<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319351508_Foreign_and_Security_Policy_of_the_Republic_of_Serbia {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2025}}</ref> Former President of Serbia [[Boris Tadić]] referred to relations with the European Union, United States, Russia, and China as the four pillars of Serbian foreign policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2009&mm=08&dd=30&nav_id=61454|title=B92 – Info – Tadi on Serbia's \"four pillars of diplomacy\"|work=B92|access-date=19 February 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219203403/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2009&mm=08&dd=30&nav_id=61454|archive-date=19 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This approach aims to maintain strategic autonomy. \n\nThe European Union remains central to Serbia’s diplomacy and by far the largest trading partner. Its [[Accession of Serbia to the European Union|accession process]] has been slow, with 22 of 35 negotiation chapters opened by 2025 and only a few closed. Key obstacles include rule of law reforms and \"normalizing\" relations with Kosovo. Public support for EU membership in Serbia has dropped to around 40% by 2025 due to perceived double standards of the EU and its key member-states towards Serbia.<ref>https://balkaninsight.com/2024/05/14/balkan-support-for-eu-accession-high-except-in-serbia-survey/ {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2025}}</ref> Serbia condemned Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine while avoiding to align with EU sanctions against Russia, reflecting its neutral stance.\n\nCountry has maintained robust diplomatic ties with Western countries, but Serbia’s refusal to recognize [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|Kosovo’s independence]] remains a major sticking point and its balancing act with non-Western powers (Russia and China, in particular) to some degree complicate relations with the United States and key European states. \n\nSerbia relies primarily on Russia and China for diplomatic support on Kosovo issue. The 2016 strategic partnership agreement and country's focal role in the [[Belt and Road Initiative]] have deepened ties with China which has become second biggest trading partner as well as investor of numerous infrastructure projects in Serbia (like the high-speed railways, motorways, and the Belgrade Metro). \n\nSerbia has worked to improve relations with those neighboring countries ([[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Albania]]) with which it has a long-standing historical tensions. However, relations with Croatia remain strained due to historical tensions, while Kosovo’s status fuels occasional flare-ups. Serbia supports the [[Open Balkan]] initiative, launched in 2019, to boost regional economic cooperation with Albania and [[North Macedonia]].<ref>https://www.euronews.rs/tema/19666/inicijativa-open-balkan {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2025}}</ref>\n\n==Diplomatic relations==\nList of countries which Serbia maintains diplomatic relations with:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |[[File:Diplomatic relations of Serbia.svg|frameless|425x425px]]\n|-\n! # !!
