Hungary took on the presidency of the [[Council of the European Union]] for half a year in 2011 and the next will be in 2024. In 2015, Hungary was the fifth largest [[OECD]] Non-[[Development Assistance Committee|DAC]] donor of [[development aid]] in the world, which represents [[List of development aid country donors|0.13% of its Gross National Income]]. In this regard, Hungary stands before [[Spain]], [[Israel]] or [[Russia]].\n\nHungary's capital city, [[Budapest]] is home to more than 100 [[embassy|embassies]] and foreign representative bodies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.123embassy.com/city.php?c=Budapest|title=Embassies in Budapest|year=2014|publisher=123embassy.com|access-date=20 November 2016}}</ref> Hungary hosts the main and regional headquarters of many international organizations as well, including [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]], [[European Police College]], [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], [[International Centre for Democratic Transition]], [[Institute of International Education]], [[International Labour Organization]], [[International Organization for Migration]], [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|International Red Cross]], Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe, [[Danube Commission (1948)|Danube Commission]] and even others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.hu/kum2005/Templates/alapsablon.aspx?NRMODE=Published&NRORIGINALURL=%2Fkum%2Fen%2Fbal%2Fforeign_policy%2Fun_sc%2Finternational_organisations.htm&NRNODEGUID=%7B45550E06-66FE-4183-A899-EDF5BD040EB5%7D&NRCACHEHINT=NoModifyGuest&printable=true |title=International organizations in Hungary |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs |access-date=20 November 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313115736/http://www.mfa.gov.hu/kum2005/Templates/alapsablon.aspx?NRMODE=Published&NRORIGINALURL=%2Fkum%2Fen%2Fbal%2Fforeign_policy%2Fun_sc%2Finternational_organisations.htm&NRNODEGUID=%7B45550E06-66FE-4183-A899-EDF5BD040EB5%7D&NRCACHEHINT=NoModifyGuest&printable=true |archive-date=13 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1989, Hungary's top foreign policy goal was achieving integration into Western economic and security organizations. It joined the [[Partnership for Peace]] program in 1994 and has actively supported the [[IFOR]] and [[SFOR]] missions in Bosnia. It also improved its often frosty neighborly relations by signing basic treaties with [[Ukraine]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Romania]]. These renounce all outstanding territorial claims and lay the foundation for constructive relations. However, the issue of [[Hungarian diaspora|ethnic Hungarian minority]] rights in Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine periodically causes bilateral tensions to flare up. Hungary since 1989 has signed all of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] documents, and served as the OSCE's Chairman-in-Office in 1997. Hungary's record of implementing [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|CSCE]] ''Helsinki Final Act'' provisions, including those on the reunification of divided families, remains among the best in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nExcept for the short-lived [[Neutral country|neutrality]] declared by the [[anti-Soviet]] leader [[Imre Nagy]] in November 1956, [[Hungary]]'s foreign policy generally followed the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] lead from 1947 to 1989. During the [[Communism|Communist]] period, Hungary maintained treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with the [[Soviet Union]], [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[German Democratic Republic]], [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]], and [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. It was one of the founding members of the Soviet-led [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[Comecon]], and it was the first country to withdraw from those organizations. After 1989, it began to orient more towards the West, joining [[NATO]] in 1999 and the [[European Union]] in 2004. In 2010, Hungary initiated its Eastern Opening Policy, marking a commitment to enhancing its relations with other nations within the Global East.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web |last=Péter |first=Dániel |date=2015 |title=The Eastern Opening - An Element of Hungary's Trade Policy |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282217890 |access-date=20 December 2023}}</ref> \n[[File:Necasmeeting.jpg|thumb|right|Meeting of [[Visegrád Group]] leaders, plus Germany and France in 2013]]\n[[File:BIMUN 2012 opening 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[United Nations]] conference in the assembly hall of [[House of Magnates]] in the [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Hungarian Parliament]]]]\n\n==Overview==\nAs with any country, Hungarian security attitudes are shaped largely by history and geography. For Hungary, this is a history of more than 400 years of domination by great powers—the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], the [[Habsburg]] dynasty, the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] during [[World War II]], and the Soviets during the [[Cold War]]—and a geography of regional instability and separation from Hungarian minorities living in neighboring countries. Hungary's foreign policy priorities, largely consistent since 1990, represent a direct response to these factors. From 1990, Hungary's top foreign policy goal was achieving integration into Western economic and security organizations. Hungary joined the [[Partnership for Peace]] program in 1994 and has actively supported the [[IFOR]] and [[SFOR]] missions in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. The [[Gyula Horn|Horn]] government achieved Hungary's most important foreign policy successes of the post-communist era by securing invitations to join both [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]] in 1997. Hungary became a member of NATO in 1999,<ref>{{cite web |title=THE ACCESSION OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC, HUNGARY AND POLAND |url=https://www.nato.int/docu/comm/1999/9904-wsh/pres-eng/03acce.pdf |website=nato.int}}</ref> and a member of the [[European Union|EU]] in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hungary |url=https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/country-profiles/hungary_en |website=europa.eu}}</ref>\n\nHungary also has improved its often frosty neighborly relations by signing basic treaties with [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Ukraine]]. These renounce all outstanding territorial claims and lay the foundation for constructive relations. However, the issue of ethnic Hungarian minority rights in Slovakia and Romania periodically causes bilateral tensions to flare up. Hungary was a signatory to the [[Helsinki Final Act]] in 1975, has signed all of the CSCE/[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] follow-on documents since 1989, and served as the OSCE's Chairman-in-Office in 1997. Hungary's record of implementing CSCE '''Helsinki Final Act''' provisions, including those on the reunification of divided families, remains among the best in eastern Europe. Hungary has been a member of the [[United Nations]] since December 1955.\n\n;The [[Gabčíkovo - Nagymaros Dams]] project\nThis involves Hungary and Czechoslovakia, and was agreed on September 16, 1977 (\"Budapest Treaty\"). The treaty envisioned a [[cross-border]] barrage system between the towns Gabčíkovo, [[Czechoslovakia]] and Nagymaros, Hungary. After an intensive campaign, the project became widely hated as a symbol of the old [[communist]] regime. In 1989 the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] government decided to suspend it. In its sentence from September 1997, the [[International Court of Justice]] stated that both sides breached their obligation and that the 1977 Budapest Treaty is still valid. In 1998 the Slovak government turned to the International Court, demanding the Nagymaros part to be built. The international dispute was partially solved in 2017.\n\nOn March 19, 2008, Hungary recognized [[Kosovo]] as an independent country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Croatia and Hungary recognize Kosovo|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/19/europe/kosovo.php|work=[[The Associated Press]]|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=2008-03-19|access-date=2008-09-21}}</ref>\n\nRelations between Hungary and its Western partners have strained, because Orban's government has  maintained relations with Russia despite [[Sanctions against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine|sanctions against Russia]] after the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Hungary's loyalties tested as Russia's war in Ukraine grinds on |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/14/hungarys-loyalties-tested-as-russias-war-in-ukraine-grinds-on |website=aljazeera.com |access-date=14 Apr 2023}}</ref>\n\n'''Illicit drugs:'''\nMajor trans-shipment point for [[Southwest Asia]]n [[heroin]] and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and transit point for [[South America]]n [[cocaine]] destined for [[Western Europe]]; limited producer of precursor [[chemical compound|chemicals]], particularly for [[amphetamine]]s and [[methamphetamine]]s\n\n'''Refugee protection:'''\nThe [[Hungarian border barrier]] was built in 2015, and Hungary was criticized by other European countries for using tear gas and water cannons on [[refugees of the Syrian Civil War]] as they were trying to pass the country.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/16/first-refugees-head-for-croatia-after-hungarys-border-crackdown-live-updates Hungary border crackdown], The Guardian 16 September 2015</ref><ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hungarian-police-spray-tear-gas-water-cannons-at-migrants/ Hungarian police spray tear gas water cannons at migrants], CBS News 16 September 2015</ref>\n\nSince 2017, [[Hungary–Ukraine relations]] have rapidly deteriorated over the issue of the [[Hungarians in Ukraine|Hungarian minority in Ukraine]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Ukraine defends education reform as Hungary promises 'pain' |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/ukraine-defends-education-reform-as-hungary-promises-pain-1.3235916 |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=27 September 2017}}</ref><ref>\"[https://www.neweurope.eu/article/hungary-ukraine-relations-hit-new-low-troop-deployment/ Hungary-Ukraine relations hit new low over troop deployment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331181346/https://www.neweurope.eu/article/hungary-ukraine-relations-hit-new-low-troop-deployment/ |date=2019-03-31 }}\".
