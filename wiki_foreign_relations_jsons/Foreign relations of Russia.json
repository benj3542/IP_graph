This article covers the foreign policy of the [[Russian Federation]] since the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] in late 1991. At present, Russia has no diplomatic relations with Ukraine due to its [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|ongoing invasion of Ukraine]]. Other than Ukraine, Russia also has no diplomatic relations with [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bhutan]], the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] or [[Solomon Islands]].\n\nKremlin's foreign policy debates show a conflict among three rival schools: [[Atlanticism|Atlanticists]], seeking a closer relationship with the [[United States]] and the [[Western World]] in general; [[Imperialism|Imperialists]], seeking a recovery of the semi-hegemonic status lost during the previous decade; and [[Slavophilia|Neo-Slavophiles]], promoting the isolation of Russia within its own cultural sphere. While Atlanticism was the dominant ideology during the first years of the new Russian Federation, under [[Andrei Kozyrev]], it came under attack for its failure to defend Russian pre-eminence in the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The promotion of [[Yevgeny Primakov]] to Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1996 marked the beginning of a more nationalistic approach to foreign policy.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ambrosio | first = Thomas | author-link = Thomas Ambrosio | title = Challenging America's Global Preeminence: Russia's Quest for Multipolarity | publisher = Routledge | date = 2005 | isbn = 0-7546-4289-5}}</ref>{{rp|33–69}}\n\nAnother major trend has been [[Eurasianism]], a school of thought that emerged during the early 20th century. Eurasianists assert that Russia is composed of [[Slavs|Slavic]], [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Asia]]tic cultures and equates [[Liberalism]] with [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] [[imperialism]]. One of the earliest ideologues of Eurasianism was the Russian historian [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]], who denounced the [[Europhile|Europhilic]] [[Czar Peter I]] and advocated Russian embracal of the Asiatic \"legacy of [[Chinggis Khan]]\" to establish a [[Trans-continental country|trans-continental]] Eurasian state. Following the [[collapse of Soviet Union]], Eurasianism gained public ascendency through the writings of philosopher [[Aleksandr Dugin]] and has become the official ideological policy under the government of [[Vladimir Putin]].{{Efn|Sources:<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fuller |first=Steve |date=23 March 2022 |title=Eurasianism as the deep history of Russia's discontent |journal=Educational Philosophy and Theory |volume=54 |issue=7 |pages=863–866 |doi=10.1080/00131857.2022.2054330 |s2cid=249047326 |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Burbank |first=Jane |date=22 March 2022 |title=The Grand Theory Driving Putin to War |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/opinion/russia-ukraine-putin-eurasianism.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230403065027/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/opinion/russia-ukraine-putin-eurasianism.html |archive-date=3 April 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Laurelle |first=Marlene |title=Russian Eurasianism: An Ideology of Empire |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8018-9073-4 |location=Baltimore, Maryland 21211 |translator-last=Gabowitsch |translator-first=Mischa}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Dixon Klump |first=Sarah |title=Russian Eurasianism: An Ideology of Empire |date=7 July 2011 |url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/russian-eurasianism-ideology-empire |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329154643/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/russian-eurasianism-ideology-empire |archive-date=29 March 2017}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Vladimir Putin]] held the presidency from January 2000 to May 2008, and again from May 2012 to the present.

He recognized the independence of [[Donetsk People's Republic|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk People's Republic|Luhansk]] within that country. Relations with the United States in particular have sharply deteriorated between 2001 and 2022, with the Kremlin blaming U.S. involvement in the Middle East and countries bordering Russia. Relations with the [[European Union]] became hostile after Russia's [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|2014 annexation of Crimea]] from Ukraine.\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia launched an [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|invasion of Ukraine]], prompting the imposition of substantial [[international sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War|economic and political sanctions]] by the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Japan, and other countries. The Russian government now has a specified \"[[Unfriendly Countries List]]\" which indicates those countries with which relations are now strained (or non-existent).

For decades, Russia and Britain struggled for influence in Afghanistan, strategically positioned between their two empires, in what became known as \"[[The Great Game]]\". Following the 1917 [[Bolshevik Revolution]], the new Soviet Union established more cordial relations with Afghanistan, and in 1919 became the first country to recognise Afghan sovereignty.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nRelations between the two nations became complicated following the 1978 communist coup known as the [[Saur Revolution]]. The new communist [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] was highly dependent on the Soviet Union, and the Soviet support for the widely disliked communist regime, and the ensuing [[Soviet–Afghan War]], led to a great hatred for the Soviets in much of the Afghan population. The Soviets occupied Afghanistan in the face of a bitter ten-year insurgency before withdrawing in 1989. Even following the withdrawal of Soviet forces, the Soviet Union provided massive support to the embattled DRA government, reaching a value of $3 billion a year in 1990. However, this relationship dissolved in 1991 along with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] itself. On 13 September 1991, the Soviet government, now dominated by Boris Yeltsin, agreed with the United States on a mutual cut off of military aid to both sides in the Afghan civil war beginning on 1 January 1992.  The post-coup Soviet government then attempted to develop political relations with the Afghan resistance. In mid-November it invited a delegation of the resistance's Afghanistan Interim Government (AIG) to Moscow where the Soviets agreed that a transitional government should prepare Afghanistan for national elections. The Soviets did not insist that Najibullah or his colleagues participate in the transitional process. Having been cut adrift both materially and politically, Najibullah's faction torn government began to fall apart, and the city of Kabul fell to the Mujahideen factions in April 1992.\n\nIn 2009, Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] announced that he wanted to be more involved in Afghanistan, supporting development of infrastructure and the army.

When Sukarno was overthrown by General Suharto, relations between the two states were significantly deteriorated, likely due to Indonesia's enforced anti-communist policy under Suharto following the [[30 September Movement|1965 unrest]].\n\nRelations between the Soviet Union and Indonesia grew tense for 20 years, but a thaw began when Gorbachev came to power. However, unlike the relations with China during Suharto's rule, the diplomatic relations were not suspended and remained intact. Indonesia's negative views of the Soviet Union had significantly increased following the 1979 Soviet-Afghan War, with many Indonesians claiming it as a \"communist crime against Muslims\".

The latest Russian census shows about 40,000 still living in Russia, but sources indicate that given the probability of an undercount, Latvians in Russia probably number about 50,000-60,000.\n|-\n|{{flag|Liechtenstein }}\n|{{dts|30 January 1994}}\n|See [[Liechtenstein–Russia relations]]\n* Liechtenstein is on Russia's [[Unfriendly countries list|list of unfriendly countries]]\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Lithuania}}||<!--Date started-->12 July 1920 and again 27 July 1991||See [[Lithuania-Russia relations]]\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Netherlands}}||  ||See [[Netherlands-Russia relations]] \n* the Netherlands has an embassy in Moscow and consulate-general in Saint Petersburg.\n* Russia has an embassy in [[The Hague]]. \n* the Netherlands is on Russia's [[Unfriendly countries list|list of unfriendly countries]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Norway}}||<!--Date started-->30 October 1905||See [[Norway–Russia relations]]\n* The two countries established formal relations in 1905-10-30<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.norvegia.ru/norsk/russland/fakta/bilaterale.htm |title=Norwegian embassy in Moscow |access-date=7 March 2018 |archive-date=5 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505132429/http://www.norvegia.ru/norsk/russland/fakta/bilaterale.htm }}</ref>\n* Norway has an [[Embassy of Norway in Moscow|embassy in Moscow]] and a consulate-general in [[Saint Petersburg]] and a consulate in [[Murmansk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norvegia.ru/|title=Norway – the official site in Russia|access-date=20 February 2015|archive-date=2 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202044949/http://www.norvegia.ru/}}</ref>\n* Russia has an embassy in Oslo and consulates-general in [[Barentsburg]] and [[Kirkenes]].<ref>[http://www.norway.mid.ru/en/ Embassy of Russia in Oslo (in English, Norwegian and Russian)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611022740/http://www.norway.mid.ru/en/ |date=11 June 2011}}</ref>\n*''See also'': [[Kola Norwegians]]\n* Norway is on Russia's [[Unfriendly countries list|list of unfriendly countries]]\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Poland}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Poland–Russia relations]]\nIn recent years, relations with Russia have worsened considerably.
