Morocco's relationships vary greatly between African, Arab, United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Western states. Morocco has had strong ties with the West in order to gain economic and political benefits.<ref name=\"nationsencyclopedia.com\">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/World-Leaders-2003/Morocco-FOREIGN-POLICY.html |title=Morocco Foreign Policy |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Nations |access-date=2009-10-23 |archive-date=2010-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205210719/http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/World-Leaders-2003/Morocco-FOREIGN-POLICY.html |url-status=live }}</ref> France and Spain remain the primary trade partners, as well as the primary creditors and foreign investors in Morocco. From the total foreign investments in Morocco, the [[European Union]] invests approximately 73.5%, whereas the Arab world invests only 19.3%. As of 2009, many countries from the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Maghreb]] regions are also becoming more involved in large-scale development projects in Morocco.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://memrieconomicblog.org/bin/content.cgi?article=190 |title=GCC Countries Invest Heavily in Morocco |access-date=2009-10-23 |archive-date=2018-08-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807190426/http://memrieconomicblog.org/bin/content.cgi?article=190 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Foreign relations]] have had a significant impact on economic and social development in Morocco. Certain evidence of foreign influence is through the many development projects, loans, investments, and free trade agreements that Morocco has with other countries. Some free trade agreements include the Euro-Mediterranean free trade area agreement with the [[European Union]]; the [[Greater Arab Free Trade Area]] with Egypt, Jordan, and Tunisia; as well as the [[US-Morocco Free Trade Agreement]] with the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medibtikar.eu/+The-many-free-trade-agreements+.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120904173523/http://www.medibtikar.eu/+The-many-free-trade-agreements+.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-04 |title=Medibtikar: EuroMed Innovation and Technology Program |access-date=2009-10-23 }}</ref> An example of recent foreign influence is through loan agreements. Morocco signed three loan agreements with the [[French Development Agency]] (AFD) in 2009, totalling up to 155 million euros. These were for the purpose of reforming the education system, rural roads and rehabilitation, as well as infrastructure projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/33687 |title=Morocco Signs 155 Million Euro Loan Agreement With France |access-date=2009-10-23 |archive-date=2009-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715215707/http://www.afrol.com/articles/33687 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Factors influencing foreign relations==\n===Role of political organization===\nPolicies associated with foreign relations are determined by [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|King Mohamed VI]], as well as his advisors, despite the fact that Morocco has a [[constitutional monarchy]].<ref name=\"nationsencyclopedia.com\"/> Morocco has had a history of monarchical rule. For example, the previous king, [[Hassan II of Morocco]], suspended parliament in 1965 and ruled directly for two years. This was in response to the discovery of a plot on the king's life, of which a political party, [[National Union of Popular Forces|UNFP]], was accused of orchestrating. Foreign relations with Western countries became strained as a result of this. Portraying Morocco as a democratic state became important if Morocco wished to receive loans and investments from foreign powers.\n\n===Role of colonialism===\nMorocco's current relations with some countries are related to its colonial history. Morocco was secretly partitioned by Spain and France and in 1912 the Moroccan territory was made into French and Spanish [[protectorate]]s. After achieving independence in 1956, Morocco still has a strong relationship with its former colonizers. Spain and France are currently the largest exporting and importing partners to Morocco. French is still popularly spoken and remains the second language in Morocco whilst Spanish is also widespread, particularly in the northern regions. France now is home to more than a million Moroccans legally residing in the country. This is the largest Moroccan population in a foreign country, followed next by Spain. These former colonizers remain influential in economic matters, such as development projects, investments, trade, and loans.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/morocco/ CIA – The World Factbook] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221202191738/https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/morocco/ |date=2022-12-02 }}. Cia.gov. Retrieved on 2011-01-10.</ref>\n\n===Role of free market===\nRelations with foreign powers, especially with the [[Western world|West]], have also been strengthened as Morocco has liberalized its economy and implemented major economic reforms. In 1993 there was major [[privatization]] and markets were opened up to foreign powers.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o4Juuaw49UC&q=morocco+history+since+1830 |title=Morocco Since 1830: A History |access-date=2009-10-23 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Morocco now is focusing more on promoting [[foreign direct investments]]. In 2007, Morocco adopted the Hassan II Fund for Development, which are measures that simplify procedures to make the process easier and more financially beneficial for foreign investors. This was done with financial incentives, as well as tax exemptions. These policies make it beneficial for other countries to have relations with Morocco so that they can take advantage of their goods. Morocco's exports are mainly agriculture, and it is one of the largest exporters of phosphate in the world. In addition, Morocco has rich fishing waters, a tourist industry, and a small manufacturing sector.\n\n===Role of foreign policy support===\nMorocco also gains financial support from countries that it assists. For example, Morocco has had a long history of supporting the United States and it has received financial support as a result. Moroccan troops were involved in Bosnia as well as in Somalia, during the operation [[Desert Storm]]. Morocco also was among the first Arab and Islamic states to denounce the [[September 11 attacks]] and declare solidarity with the American people in the [[War on Terror|war against terror]].<ref name=\"somalipress.com\">[http://www.somalipress.com/morocco-overview/foreign-relations-morocco-1097.html Foreign Relations of Morocco] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204224216/http://www.somalipress.com/morocco-overview/foreign-relations-morocco-1097.html |date=2009-02-04 }}.

In 1998, the U.S. Secretary of Defense, [[William Cohen]], said that Morocco and the U.S. have \"mutual concerns over transnational terrorism\" as well as interests in \"the effort to control the spread of [[weapons of mass destruction]]\".<ref>[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=41811 Defense.gov News Article: Cohen Renews U.S.-Morocco Ties] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130123927/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=41811 |date=2009-11-30 }}. Defenselink.mil. Retrieved on 2011-01-10.</ref> In recognition of its support for the War on Terror, in June 2004 U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] designated Morocco as a major non-NATO ally. \nAnother case of mutual foreign policy interests is with Saudi Arabia. Ties between these countries were strengthened when Morocco sent troops to help Saudi Arabia during the 1992 Gulf War. This was perceived as a \"gesture to support Western and Arab allies\". Morocco's relationship to countries in the Middle East and its contribution to the Palestinian cause have created stronger relations between these countries.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=o4Ju-uaw49UC&q=morocco+history+since+1830 Morocco since 1830: a history – Google Books] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230908004555/https://books.google.com/books?id=o4Ju-uaw49UC&q=morocco+history+since+1830 |date=2023-09-08 }}. Books.google.ca. Retrieved on 2011-01-10.</ref>\n\n===Role of immigration===\nAnother factor determining relations is how much immigration the country receives from Morocco. The beginning of major migration to Europe began during the [[French protectorate in Morocco|colonial era]] (1912 to 1956). During World War I and II, France had an urgent need for manpower, which led to the recruitment of tens of thousands of Moroccan men to work in factories, mines, and in the army.<ref name=\"migrationinformation.org\">[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=339 Migration Information Source – Morocco: From Emigration Country to Africa's Migration Passage to Europe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210100911/http://migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=339 |date=2014-02-10 }}. Migrationinformation.org. Retrieved on 2011-01-10.</ref> Another increase in immigration from Morocco to France was during the Algerian war of independence. France stopped recruiting workers from Algeria and instead accepted more Moroccan factory and mine labourers. Immigration increased even further from 1962 to 1972 when economic growth in Europe occurred, which led to a greater demand for low-skilled labour. At this time, Morocco signed major labour recruitment agreements with European countries, such as France, West Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands. This led to a more diverse spread of emigration, which until this time was focused primarily on the country of France.\n\nMorocco's perceived identity plays a role in its relations with other countries. Numerous countries have strong relations with Morocco because of its history of being a Western ally. For example, Morocco has the longest friendship treaties with the United States. This is important for US interests because Morocco is a stable, democratizing, and liberalizing MENA & Muslim nation. Geopolitical benefits are evident because ties to Morocco means that an ally is established in Africa, in the Maghreb region. Morocco's identity as a Muslim state has also strengthened ties with the Persian Gulf countries as a result of 9/11 and the \"War on Terror\". This has resulted in Arab countries, including members of the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]] (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates), choosing to invest more in Morocco.<ref>[http://memrieconomicblog.org/bin/content.cgi?article=190 GCC Countries Invest Heavily in Morocco] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807190426/http://memrieconomicblog.org/bin/content.cgi?article=190 |date=2018-08-07 }}.

Representatives from both sides initiated a series of low-level contacts that led to a resumption of diplomatic ties in April 1985. For Mauritania, the détente with Morocco promised to end the threat of Moroccan incursions, and it also removed the threat of Moroccan support for opposition groups formed during the [[Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla|Haidalla]] presidency. Through the agreement with Mauritania, Morocco sought to tighten its control over the [[Western Sahara]] by denying the [[Polisario]] one more avenue for infiltrating guerrillas into the disputed territory.<ref name=cs>Handloff, Robert E. \"Relations with France\".

Taya made his first visit to Morocco in October 1985 (prior to visits to Algeria and [[Tunisia]]) in the wake of Moroccan claims that Polisario guerrillas were again traversing Mauritanian territory. The completion of a sixth [[berm]] just north of Mauritania's crucial rail link along the border with the Western Sahara, between [[Nouadhibou]] and the iron ore mines, complicated relations between Mauritania and Morocco. Polisario guerrillas in mid-1987 had to traverse Mauritanian territory to enter the Western Sahara, a situation that invited Morocco's accusations of Mauritanian complicity. Moreover, any engagements near the sixth berm would threaten to spill over into Mauritania and jeopardize the rail link.<ref name=cs/>\n|-\n|{{Flag|South Africa}}\n|10 May 1994\n|Both countries established diplomatic relations on 10 May 1994<ref>{{Cite web |title=Afrique du Sud |url=http://www.diplomatie.ma/Politique%C3%A9trang%C3%A8re/Afrique/Relationsbilaterales/tabid/177/vw/1/ItemID/136/language/en-US/Default.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129174219/http://www.diplomatie.ma/Politique%C3%A9trang%C3%A8re/Afrique/Relationsbilaterales/tabid/177/vw/1/ItemID/136/language/en-US/Default.aspx |archive-date=29 November 2014 |access-date=21 November 2023 |website=Royaume du Maroc Ministere des Affaires Etrangeres et de la Cooperation |language=fr}}</ref>\n*Morocco has an embassy in [[Pretoria]].\n*South Africa has an embassy in [[Rabat]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Sudan}}||21 March 1959||\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 21 March 1959.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nSudan is one of the states that recognize Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara.

The issue of sovereignty over [[Western Sahara]] remains unresolved. The territory—an area of [[barren vegetation|wasteland]] and desert bordering the [[Atlantic Ocean]] between [[Mauritania]] and Morocco—is contested by Morocco and the Polisario (an [[independence]] movement based in the region of [[Tindouf]], Algeria). Morocco's claim to sovereignty over the Sahara is based largely on an historical argument of traditional loyalty of the [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] tribal leaders to the Moroccan [[sultan]] as spiritual leader and ruler. The [[Polisario Front]] claims to represent the aspirations of the Western Saharan inhabitants for independence. Algeria claims none of the territory for itself but maintains that Sahrawis should determine the territory's future status.\n\nFrom 1904 until 1975, [[Spain]] occupied the entire territory, which is divided into a northern portion, the [[Saguia el-Hamra]], and a southern two-thirds, known as [[Río de Oro]]. In 1973, the Polisario Front (Popular Front for the Liberation of the Saguia el Hamra and Rio de Oro) formed to combat the Spanish occupation of the territory. In November 1975, King Hassan mobilized 350,000 unarmed Moroccan citizens in what came to be known as the \"[[Green March]]\" into Western Sahara. The march was designed to both demonstrate and strengthen Moroccan claims to the territory. On November 14 of the same year, Spain, Morocco, and Mauritania announced a tripartite agreement for an interim administration under which Spain agreed to share administrative authority with Morocco and Mauritania, leaving aside the question of sovereignty. With the establishment of a Moroccan and Mauritanian presence throughout the territory, however, Spain's role in the administration of the Western Sahara ceased altogether.\n\nAfter a period of hostilities, Mauritania withdrew from the territory in 1979 and signed a peace treaty with the Polisario relinquishing all claims to the territory. Moroccan troops took control of the region vacated by Mauritania and later proclaimed the territory reintegrated into Morocco. Morocco subsequently built the [[Moroccan Wall]], a network of [[fortified]] [[berm]]s around the largest portion of Western Sahara and has since asserted administrative control over that territory. Polisario remains in control over the easternmost part of the territory.\n\nAt the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) summit in June 1981, King Hassan announced his willingness to hold a referendum in the Western Sahara. Subsequent meetings of an OAU Implementation Committee proposed a [[cease-fire]], a [[United Nations peacekeeping]] force, and an interim administration to assist with an OAU-UN-supervised referendum on the issue of independence or [[annexation]]. In 1984, the OAU seated a delegation of the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] (SADR), the shadow government of the [[Polisario]]; Morocco, consequently, withdrew from the OAU.\n\nIn 1988, Moroccan and Polisario representatives agreed on a UN peace plan. A UN-brokered [[cease-fire]] and settlement plan went into effect on September 6, 1991. Implementation of the settlement plan, which calls for a popular [[referendum]] among the [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] natives of the territory to determine its final status (integration into Morocco or independence), has been repeatedly postponed because of differences between the parties. In 2003 the UN launched the [[Baker Plan]], allowing Moroccan settlers the vote and instituting a five-year Sahrawi [[Western Sahara Authority|autonomous rule]] under Moroccan [[sovereignty]] before the referendum. This plan won the unanimous approval of the [[Security Council]] through SC Resolution 1495, and was unexpectedly accepted by the Polisario. Morocco however refused the plan, stating that it is no longer willing to accept a referendum that includes the possibility of independence, but that it is willing to discuss an autonomy-based solution.

France and Spain secretly partitioned Morocco, despite the evident disagreements this caused with Germany. The Treaty of Fes in 1912 made Morocco a protectorate of France. Struggles and opposition ensued when France exiled the Sultan Mohammed V, replacing him with Mohammed Ben Aarafa. The development of a strong independence movement together with a common trend of decolonization led to Morocco being granted independence in 1956.<ref>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5431.htm Morocco] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230129200207/https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5431.htm |date=2023-01-29 }}.

It was only after his return that the policy of decolonisation ended and a policy of a new France started to emerge. 1962 marked Algerian independence and the revision of the Fifth Republic allowed the President of France to be directly elected. De Gaulle was able to set out his vision for the Third World, Africa and French influence in the wider world. Relations with Morocco were very cordial during the reign of King Mohammed V, only to take a turn for the worse when the French secret service delivered Ben Barka to some Moroccan agents, who eventually killed him and the affair turned into a serious and personal diplomatic row between King Hassan II and General de Gaulle, which lasted until the exit of the latter from politics in 1969.\n\nDuring Pompidou's presidency a new entente developed between Morocco and France when new initiatives emerged in the field of co-operation setting up new institutions to deal with future aid and Moroccan economic development. Giscard d'Estaing's presidency provided a more pronounced support for Morocco and relations reached their zenith leading to a type of partnership in the affairs of Africa. The French-Moroccan intervention in Zaire was evidence of this partnership and President Giscard d'Estaing was in favour of Morocco's annexation of the Western Sahara. French military and public aid allocated to Morocco was unparalleled during this period when compared to previous aid received.\n\nMitterrand's presidency did not affect the special relations between Morocco and France but intensified after a shaky beginning. Although human rights proved difficult to resolve, nevertheless, the President kept the issue going together with Danielle Mitterrand, as President of France-Liberté. Towards the end of his first term in office, a more challenging period for constitutional debate emerged as a result of cohabitation which occurred between 1986 and 1988, adding another dimension to alternance to the end of Mitterrand's second septennat to the arrival of Jacques Chirac.\n\nBy now a more stable and continuous policy emerged to encourage investment and cooperation on major projects not only in agriculture and dam projects but also involving both French and Moroccan enterprises in creating a solid and a durable industrial base from aeronautics to automobile industries, to the Euro-Med Port at Tangier and Renault-Nissan Plant and TGV and tram projects in Casablanca and Rabat concluded under the presidency of Sarkozy.\n\nBoth France and the USA played an important role in supplying the Moroccan military with all the hardware and equipment needed to redress the balance of power within the region, especially against Algeria's rearmament, to ensure security in the Western Sahara and keep the Al Qaeda branch of the Maghreb outside the Moroccan borders. The Moroccan military has been modernised and trained to be admitted within the USA-NATO forces to carry out regular exercises, as well as involving other NATO members in the fight against any terrorist threat in the Mediterranean, the Atlantic and the Sahara regions.\n\nFranco-Moroccan co-operation also extends to the African continent and both played a complementary role in helping to resolve the problems in the Congo, in Chad and in many other fields as well as in the economy and politics of the region. Morocco has become the preferred destination for African students to attend university, instead of going to France, or to attend military academies, Management and Administration or medical schools. Moroccan banking has a significant hold on some African countries as well as Moroccan expertise in energy production, construction, mining extraction, diamond and gold exploitation as well as a great expertise in agriculture and infrastructure in general. In short, many sectors which used to be the domain of France have been gradually taken over by Moroccan companies and Moroccan know-how.\n|-\n|{{DEU}}\n|26 March 1957\n|See [[Germany–Morocco relations]]\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 26 March 1957<ref>{{Cite web |title=Marokko: Steckbrief |url=https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/de/service/laender/marokko-node/steeckbrief/224060 |access-date=21 November 2023 |website=Auswärtiges Amt |language=de |archive-date=21 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231121143148/https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/de/service/laender/marokko-node/steeckbrief/224060 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Morocco has an embassy in Berlin and five consulates.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Botschaft des Königreichs Marokko in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland {{!}} Botschaft des Königreichs Marokko in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland |url=http://www.botschaft-marokko.de/ |access-date=2022-04-11 |website=www.botschaft-marokko.de |archive-date=2022-04-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220411020743/http://www.botschaft-marokko.de/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Germany has an embassy in Rabat and three consulates.
