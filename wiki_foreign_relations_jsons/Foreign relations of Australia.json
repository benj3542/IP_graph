Key concerns include free trade, terrorism, refugees, economic co-operation with [[Asia]] and stability in the [[Indo-Pacific]].

Outside of the prime minister, the role of [[Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom]] (established in 1910) remained the most significant conduit for Australian foreign relations, with its significance emphasised by the fact that the first three appointees were former prime ministers. It has been suggested that, for Australia's early governments, foreign policy meant \"relations with London on matters of imperial foreign policy on which Australia might have an interest\".<ref name=lowy>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/alfred-deakin-roots-australian-foreign-policy|title=Alfred Deakin and the roots of Australian foreign policy|first=Judith|last=Brett|date=19 September 2017|publisher=Lowy Institute|access-date=3 June 2024}}</ref>\n\nAustralia's first prime minister [[Edmund Barton]] was in favour of a uniform foreign policy for the British Empire, suggesting Australia could have no \"foreign policy of its own\" but expected that the British government would defer to the Australian perspective for \"regional\" imperial policy.{{sfn|Bird|2008|p=3}} Barton's successor [[Alfred Deakin]] also repeatedly lobbied the British government for greater consultation on imperial foreign policy and suggested the establishment of an imperial department of state to coordinate policy, as part of his broader support for an [[Imperial Federation]].{{sfn|Bird|2008|p=4}} Deakin took some of the first steps towards diplomatic independence by dealing directly with the Japanese consul-general, for which he was reminded by the [[Colonial Office]] that it \"expected Australia to conduct any dealings with a foreign power through London\". He also dealt directly with the U.S. consul in Sydney to engineer the visit of the [[Great White Fleet]] in 1908.<ref name=lowy/> His actions \"set a precedent for unilateralism\" in foreign policy that was followed by his immediate successors as prime minister, although with a continued reliance on the British diplomatic service and policy-making apparatus and no efforts to develop Australian equivalents.{{sfn|Bird|2008|p=4}}\n\n===World War I and 1920s===\nWorld War I brought about an increase in direct Australian engagement with governments outside the British Empire, prompted by strategic concerns including the fate of German territories in the Pacific captured by Australian troops during the war. Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]] visited the United States in 1918 and \"in a series of meetings and speeches, called on the US to cooperate with Australia in ensuring postwar security in the Far East\".{{sfn|Cuffe|2021|p=16}} At the [[1919 Paris Peace Conference]], Hughes led an Australian section within the British Empire delegation and co-signed the [[Treaty of Versailles]] on behalf of Australia, as with other British [[dominion]]s. Hughes lobbied powerfully for Australian interests at the conference, including the granting of [[League of Nations]] mandates over the former [[German New Guinea]] and [[Nauru]] and opposition to Japan's [[Racial Equality Proposal]] to protect the [[White Australia policy]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/versailles-treaty|title=Versailles Treaty|publisher=National Museum of Australia|access-date=3 June 2024}}</ref>\n\nThe 1920s marked \"the genesis of a distinct Australian foreign policy\", largely in response to changing power dynamics and the decline in British influence in the Pacific following the [[Washington Naval Conference]] of 1922 influence.{{sfn|Cuffe|2021|p=5}} Australia continued continued to rely on \"the UK and its imperial machinery for diplomatic representation and economic and material security\".{{sfn|Cuffe|2021|p=4}} Following the [[1923 Imperial Conference]], attempts to formulate a uniform imperial foreign policy were largely abandoned in favour of a system of dominion ratification of British decisions.{{sfn|Bird|2008|p=6}} Governmental interest in foreign policy declined during the [[Great Depression in Australia|Great Depression]] as the [[James Scullin|Scullin government]] concentrated on internal economic matters. In 1929, internationalist [[Frederic Eggleston]] complained to a [[Australian Senate committees|Senate committee]] that \"no parliament which is responsible for its own foreign policy has less discussion on foreign affairs than does the Australian Parliament\".{{sfn|Bird|2008|p=7}}\n\nWhile yet to exchange formal diplomatic representatives, Australia made a number of \"quasi-diplomatic\" appointments in the post-war period, who functioned as official representatives of the Australian government but held no [[diplomatic rank]]. These included appointment of [[Henry Braddon]] to the United States in 1918 with the title of \"commissioner\" and the appointment of Clive Voss as \"commercial agent\" in France in 1919.{{sfn|Schedvin|2008|p=24}} In 1921, Australia appointed its first official representative in Asia, with the appointment of Edward S. Little as trade commissioner to China, based in Shanghai.{{sfn|Schedvin|2008|p=28}} Senator [[Thomas Bakhap]] undertook a trade mission to China in 1922 at the instigation of Hughes,{{sfn|Schedvin|2008|p=31}} and in the same year Egbert Sheaf was appointed as a trade commissioner to \"the East\", based in Singapore.{{sfn|Schedvin|2008|p=34}} The initial trade commissioner service was partially funded by state governments and ultimately failed due to a lack of support from Prime Minister [[Stanley Bruce]] and state premiers.{{sfn|Schedvin|2008|p=36}}\n\n===1930s: appeasement and rearmament===\nThe appointment of the [[Lyons government]] in 1932 marked a renewed interest in foreign policy, complemented by the establishment of foreign policy departments at universities and non-governmental advisory bodies like the [[Australian Institute of International Affairs]]. Prime Minister [[Joseph Lyons]] took a keen interest in foreign relations and exerted significant influence over the government's foreign policy.{{sfn|Bird|2008|p=23}} He authorised three \"Pacific initiatives\" as a sign of greater Australian interest in the Asia-Pacific. The first was the [[Australian Eastern Mission]] of 1934, led by deputy prime minister [[John Latham (judge)|John Latham]], which visited seven Asian countries and has been identified as a milestone in the early development of Australian foreign policy.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2008-08/apo-nid2694.pdf|title=Within China's Orbit?: China Through the Eyes of the Australian Parliament|first=Timothy|last=Kendall|year=2008|publisher=Department of Parliamentary Services, Parliament of Australia|isbn=978-0975201589|page=37}}</ref> The second initiative was the appointment in 1935 of Australian representatives in China, the Dutch East Indies, Japan, and United States – albeit below the rank of ambassador – where previously Australia's interests had been represented solely by British officials. The third was Lyons's \"Pacific Pact\" proposal, which envisioned a [[non-aggression pact]] between the major powers in the Pacific. Although he championed the pact at the [[1937 Imperial Conference]], discussions failed to progress.{{sfn|Bird|2008|p=25}} In Bird's opinion, \"the Lyons years should thus be seen as a part of the evolution of Australian external policy from dependency towards autonomy […] it is perhaps the continuation and acceleration of the process of transition for which Lyons as Prime Minister ought to be best remembered\".{{sfn|Bird|2008|p=336}}\n\n===World War II===\nThe first accredited diplomat sent to a foreign country was [[Richard Casey, Baron Casey|Richard Casey]], appointed as the first Minister to the United States in January 1940.<ref>Roger John Bell, ''Unequal allies: Australian-American relations and the Pacific war'' (Melbourne University Press, 1977)</ref> This was followed shortly after by the arrival of the first Australian high commissioner to Canada,  and by appointments of Ministers to Japan in 1940 and China in 1941.  With the entry of Japan into the war in December 1941 and the failure of British forces at Singapore, there was a genuine fear of an imminent Japanese invasion. The only solution was to  come under American  protection.<ref>Peter Edwards, \"Curtin, MacArthur and the 'surrender of sovereignty': A historiographical assessment.\" ''Australian Journal of International Affairs'' 55.2 (2001): 175-185.\n</ref>  Ever since that time, United States has been the most important security ally. The close security relationship with the United States was formalized in 1951 by the Australia, New Zealand, United States Security ([[ANZUS]]) Treaty which remains the cornerstone of Australian security arrangements.<ref>T.V. Millar, ''Australia in peace and war: External relations. 1788–1977'' (1978), pp.135–210.</ref>.\n\nIn parallel with the evolution of the British Empire to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], Australia progressively took responsibility for fully managing its foreign relations with other states.  Australia concluded an agreement in 1944 with New Zealand dealing with the security, welfare, and advancement of the people of the dependent territories of the Pacific (the ANZAC pact).<ref>Joseph Gabriel Starke, ''The [[ANZUS]] Treaty Alliance'' (Melbourne University Press, 1965)</ref>  Australia was one of the founders of the [[United Nations]] (1945) and the [[South Pacific Commission]] (1947), and in 1950, it proposed the [[Colombo Plan]] to assist developing countries in Asia.  After the war, Australia played a role in the [[Far Eastern Commission]] in Japan and supported Indonesian independence during that country's revolt against the Dutch (1945–49).<ref>E. G. Whitlam, \"Australia, Indonesia and Europe's empires.\" ''Australian Journal of International Affairs'' (1980) 34#1 pp: 3–12.</ref>\n\n=== Cold War ===\n\nAs the [[Cold War]] deepened, Australia aligned itself fully with the Western Powers.  In addition to contributing to UN forces in the [[Korean War]] – it was the first country to announce it would do so after the United States – Australia sent troops to assist in putting down the communist revolt in Malaya in 1948–60 and later to combat the Indonesian-supported invasion of [[Sarawak]] in 1963–65.<ref>Percy Claude Spender, ''Exercises in diplomacy; the ANZUS treaty and the Colombo Plan'' (1969).</ref>  Australia sent troops to repel communism and assist South Vietnamese and American forces in the [[Vietnam War]], in a move that stirred up antiwar activism at home.<ref>Peter Geoffrey Edwards, ''A Nation at War: Australian Politics, society and diplomacy during the Vietnam War 1965–1975'' (Allen & Unwin, 1997)</ref>  Australia has been active in the [[Five Eyes]] intelligence alliance, and in the Australia – New Zealand – [[United Kingdom]] agreement and the [[Five Power Defence Arrangement]]—successive arrangements with Britain and New Zealand to ensure the security of Singapore and [[Malaysia]].{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}\n\n===Contemporary issues===\nAfter the end of the Cold War, Australia remained an important contributor to UN peacekeeping missions and to other multilateral security missions, often in alliance with the United States.  Notably, it joined coalition forces in the Persian [[Gulf War]] in 1991, the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-2021)]], the [[Iraq War]] of 2003–2011 and the [[War in Iraq (2013-2017)]].  In 1999 Australian peace keeping forces intervened in [[East Timor]] following its referendum to secede from Indonesia. In 2006 Australia sent a contingent of Australian troops to the state to assist in the [[2006 East Timor crisis]].<ref>James Cotton, ''East Timor, Australia and regional order: intervention and its aftermath in Southeast Asia'' (Routledge, 2004)</ref>  Australia has also most recently{{when|date=August 2025}} led security assistance, peacekeeping and policing missions elsewhere in its neighbourhood, including in the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Tonga]].\n\nIn the late 20th Century and early 21st Century, a new element in Australia's foreign relations was the growing relationship with the [[People's Republic of China]].  After the establishment of diplomatic relations in December 1972, Sino-Australian relations grew rapidly, to a point where China became Australia's main trading partner and extensive official and people-to-people links were well established. In the first 15 years of the 21st Century, Australia maintained privileged relations with both the United States and China.{{cn|date=August 2025}} Since 2017, Sino-Australian relations have deteriorated dramatically, as a result of Australian criticism of policies and actions taken under [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party]] [[Xi Jinping]].{{cn|date=August 2025}} This has strongly influenced recent Australian bilateral and multi-lateral engagements such as the Pacific Step-Up with Pacific Island states, the development of comprehensive strategic partnerships with a number of regional states, and the pursuit of alliances directed at countering Chinese predominance in the Indo-Pacific region. Since 2017, existing security arrangements have been augmented by a revived [[Quadrilateral Security Dialogue]] involving India, Japan and United States, the 2021 [[AUKUS]] security partnership with the United States and United Kingdom and the 2022 Australia-Japan [[Reciprocal Access Agreement]], which provides for closer Australian-Japanese cooperation on defence and humanitarian operations.\n\n==International agencies, treaties, and agreements==\n\n=== Membership of international organizations and groupings ===\n{{see also|Australia and the United Nations}}\n\nOne of the drafters of the UN Charter, Australia has given firm support to the United Nations system. Australia held the first Presidency of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] in 1946 and provided the first military observers under UN auspices a year later, to Indonesia. It has been a member of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] a further four times, in 1956–57, 1973–74, 1986–87 and 2013–14.<ref>*[https://www.unaa.org.au/learn/australia-and-the-un/australia-and-un-security-council/ Australia and the UN Security Council]* United Nations Association of Australia.

Australia takes a prominent part in many other UN activities, including peacekeeping, disarmament negotiations, and narcotics control.  In September 1999, acting under a UN Security Council mandate, Australia led an international coalition to restore order in East Timor upon Indonesia's withdrawal from that territory.  Australia has also been closely engaged in international development cooperation and humanitarian assistance through the [[Specialized agencies]], Funds and Programmes and Regional Commissions of the United Nations and major International Financial Institutions, in particular the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]].\n\nAustralia is a member of the [[G20]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] forum.  It is active in meetings of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Commonwealth Heads of Government]], the [[Pacific Islands Forum]] and other Pacific Islands regional organizations and the [[Indian Ocean Rim Association]].  It has been a leader in the [[Cairns Group]] – countries pressing for agricultural trade reform in the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) negotiations. Australia is also a member of [[MIKTA]],  an informal and diverse middle power partnership between Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey and Australia, led by its foreign ministers, which seeks to promote an effective, rules-based global order.\n\nAustralia has devoted particular attention in the early 21st century to promoting regional architecture centred around the countries of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), to support dialogue on political, security and economic challenges in the Indo-Pacific region. Australia is an active participant in the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), and the ASEAN sponsored [[East Asia Summit]]. Australia's place at the 2005 inaugural summit was only secured after it agreed to [[doi:10.1093/chinesejil/jms057|reverse its policy and accede]] to ASEAN's [[Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia]]. Australia had been reluctant to sign the treaty out of concerns regarding how it would affect Australia's obligation under other treaty arrangements including [[ANZUS]].\n\n=== Security groupings ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Instrument\n!Countries\n|-\n|[[ANZUS]]  || {{flag|Australia}} • {{flag|New Zealand}}  (partially suspended) • {{flag|United States}}\n|-\n|[[AUKUS]]  || {{flag|Australia}} • {{flag|United Kingdom}} • {{flag|United States}}\n|-\n|[[Five Power Defence Arrangements]] || {{flag|Australia}} • {{flag|New Zealand}} • {{flag|Singapore}} • {{flag|Malaysia}} • {{flag|United Kingdom}}\n|-\n|[[Quadrilateral Security Dialogue]]  || {{flag|Australia}} • {{flag|India}} • {{flag|Japan}} • {{flag|United States}}\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Special strategic partnership ===\n*[[Japan]] (as of 2014).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://japan.embassy.gov.au/tkyo/Strategic-partnership.html|title=Australian Embassy in|website=japan.embassy.gov.au}}</ref>  Under this partnership, Australia and Japan have established a strong and broad-ranging security relationship under the renewed 2022 Australia-Japan Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation.<ref>*[https://www.dfat.gov.au/countries/japan/australia-japan-joint-declaration-security-cooperation Australia-Japan Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation]* Australian Department of Foreign Affairs.
