During the presidency of [[Sukarno]], Indonesia's foreign relations were marked by engagement with other newly independent nations in Asia and Africa, as exemplified by the [[Bandung Conference]], the subsequent foundation of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and a confrontational attitude towards Western powers, justified by a belief in the [[CONEFO]] and opposition to what Sukarno termed as [[Nekolim|NEKOLIM]] ([[Neocolonialism]] and [[Imperialism]]).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bevins |first=Vincent |title=The Jakarta method : Washington's anticommunist crusade & the mass murder program that shaped our world |date=2020 |isbn=978-1-5417-4240-6 |location=New York, NY |oclc=1117633696 }}</ref>\n\nAfter a [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66|US-backed ouster]] of Sukarno and left-wing elements in 1965, Indonesian foreign policy underwent a major shift under the [[New Order (Indonesia)|\"New Order\" government]], as President [[Suharto]] moved away from the stridently anti-Western, anti-American posturing that characterised the [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|latter part of the Sukarno era]]. Following [[Fall of Suharto|Suharto's ouster in 1998]], Indonesia's government has preserved the broad outlines of Suharto's independent, moderate foreign policy. Preoccupation with domestic problems has not prevented successive presidents from travelling abroad.\n\n[[Indonesia]]'s relations with the international community were strained as a result of [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|its invasion of neighbouring East Timor in December 1975]], the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|subsequent annexation and occupation]], the [[East Timorese independence referendum, 1999|independence referendum in 1999]], and the [[1999 East Timorese crisis|resulting violence afterwards]]. As one of the founding members of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), established in 1967, and also as the largest country in [[Southeast Asia]], Indonesia has put ASEAN as the cornerstone of its foreign policy and outlook. After the transformation from Suharto's regime to [[Post-Suharto era|a relatively open and democratic country in the 21st century]], Indonesia today exercises its influence to promote co-operation, development, democracy, security, peace and stability in the region through its leadership in ASEAN.<ref name=\"Antara\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/78248/indonesia-successfully-takes-asean-to-greater-height\n |title        = Indonesia successfully takes ASEAN to greater height\n |author       = Jafar M Sidik\n |date         = 7 December 2011\n |publisher    = Antara News\n |access-date  = 30 May 2013\n |archive-date = 5 March 2016\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305031602/http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/78248/indonesia-successfully-takes-asean-to-greater-height\n |url-status   = live\n}}</ref> Currently, [[Israel]] is the only UN member state that does not have formal diplomatic relations with Indonesia, although they maintain informal relations.\n\nIndonesia managed to play a role as a peacemaker in the [[2008–2013 Cambodian–Thai border crisis]].

Here is an overview of the historical context of Indonesia's foreign policy:\n\n* Founding Principles: Indonesia's foreign policy is rooted in the country's founding principles of Pancasila, which emphasizes peaceful coexistence, mutual respect, and non-interference in the domestic affairs of other countries.<ref>Rizal Sukma, \"The evolution of Indonesia's foreign policy: an Indonesian view.\" ''Asian Survey'' 35.3 (1995): 304–315 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2645547 online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221106124801/https://www.jstor.org/stable/2645547 |date=6 November 2022 }}</ref>\n* [[Western New Guinea]]. The western part of New Guinea was under Dutch colonial rule and known as \"West Irian.\" When Indonesia gained independence from the Netherlands in 1945, the Dutch retained control over West Irian, but Indonesia claimed it. The United Nations supervised the transfer of West Irian to Indonesia in 1963. The region officially became a part of Indonesia in 1969 through a UN-sanctioned referendum known as the Act of Free Choice.<ref>John Saltford, \"United Nations involvement with the act of self-determination in West Irian (Indonesian West New Guinea) 1968 to 1969.\" ''Indonesia'' 69 (2000): 71–92.

The occupation lasted for 24 years and was marked by widespread human rights abuses, violence, and resistance from the East Timorese people. The international community largely condemned the occupation. Various human rights organizations and activists put pressure on Indonesia to leave. In 1999, Indonesia agreed to hold a UN-sponsored referendum to determine its political status. The majority of the East Timorese people voted for independence, leading to widespread violence and destruction orchestrated by pro-Indonesia militias. International peacekeeping forces, led by Australia, restored order. Timor-Leste finally achieved independence in 2002.<ref>James Cotton, ''East Timor, Australia and regional order: intervention and its aftermath in Southeast Asia'' (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=RQkx1pf2DHgC&dq=Indonesia+%22East+Timor:%22&pg=PP1 online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230715070917/https://books.google.com/books?id=RQkx1pf2DHgC&dq=Indonesia+%22East+Timor:%22&pg=PP1 |date=15 July 2023}}.</ref>\n* Territorial Integrity: Indonesia places great importance on its territorial integrity and has been firm in its stance against any threats to its sovereignty.

Since then, [[Brunei]], [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]], and [[Cambodia]] also have joined ASEAN. While organised to promote shared economic, social, and cultural goals, ASEAN acquired a security dimension after Vietnam's liberation of Cambodia in 1979; this aspect of ASEAN expanded with the establishment of the ASEAN Regional Forum in 1994, which comprises 22 countries, including the US.\n\nThe Indonesian capital [[Jakarta]] is also the seat of ASEAN Secretariat. Other than serving their diplomatic missions for Indonesia, numerous of foreign embassies and diplomatic mission in [[Jakarta]] are also accredited to ASEAN. The presence of the ASEAN Headquarters has made [[Jakarta]] a diplomatic hub in Southeast Asia in some regards.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Indonesia's domestic troubles distracted it from ASEAN matters and consequently reduced its influence within the organisation. However, after the political and economic transformation, from the turmoil of 1998 ''[[Post-Suharto era|Reformasi]]'' to the relatively open and democratic civil society with rapid economic growth in the 2010s, Indonesia returned to the region's diplomatic stage by assuming its leadership role in ASEAN in 2011. Indonesia is viewed to have weight, international legitimacy and global appeal to draw support and attention from around the world to ASEAN. Indonesia believes that ASEAN can contribute positively to the international community, by promoting economic development and co-operation, improving security, peace, the stability of ASEAN, and making the Southeast Asia region far from conflicts.<ref name=\"Antara\" />\n\nIndonesia's bilateral relations with three neighbouring ASEAN members—Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam—are not without challenges. If not appropriately managed, it would result in mutual mistrust and suspicion, thus hindering bilateral and regional co-operation. In the era of rising Indonesia, which might assert its leadership role within ASEAN, the problem could become more significant. Nevertheless, the rise of Indonesia should be regarded in the sense of optimism. First, although Indonesia is likely to become assertive, the general tone of its foreign policy is mainly liberal and accommodating. The consolidation of the Indonesian democratic government played a key role and influence in ASEAN. The second, institutional web of ASEAN will sustain engagements and regular meetings between regional elites, thus deepening their mutual understanding and personal connections.<ref>{{cite book|title= Indonesia's Ascent: Power, Leadership, and the Regional Order, Critical Studies of the Asia-Pacific |first=Christopher B. |last=Roberts |editor1=Christopher B.

Problems in Timor and Indonesia's reluctance to implement economic reform at times complicated Indonesia's relationship with donors. In 1992 the IGGI aid coordination group ceased to meet and the coordination activities were transferred to meetings arranged by the World Bank through the CGI.

[[Indonesia–United States relations]]\n\nThe United States has important economic, commercial, and security interests in Indonesia. It remains a lynchpin of regional security due to its strategic location astride a number of key international maritime straits, particularly the [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]]. Relations between Indonesia and the US are positive and have advanced since the election of President Yudhoyono in October 2004. The US played a role in Indonesian independence in the late 1940s and appreciated Indonesia's role as an anti-[[Communism|communist]] bulwark during the [[Cold War]]. Cooperative relations are maintained today, although no formal security treaties bind the two countries. The United States and Indonesia share the common goal of maintaining peace, security, and stability in the region and engaging in a dialogue on threats to regional security. Cooperation between the US and Indonesia on counter-terrorism has increased steadily since 2002, as terrorist attacks in Bali (October 2002 and October 2005), [[Jakarta]] (August 2003 and September 2004) and other regional locations demonstrated the presence of terrorist organisations, principally [[Jemaah Islamiyah]], in Indonesia. The United States has welcomed Indonesia's contributions to regional security, especially its leading role in helping restore democracy in [[Cambodia]] and in mediating territorial disputes in the [[South China Sea]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Venezuela}}||9 October 1959||See [[Indonesia–Venezuela relations]]\n\n* Since the diplomatic relations established in 1959, Indonesia and Venezuela enjoy friendly ties.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Venezuela, RI celebrate 50 years of friendly ties\n| url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/03/venezuela-ri-celebrate-50-years-friendly-ties.html\n| author = Veeramalla Anjaiah\n| date = 3 July 2009 <!-- , 3:02 PM -->\n| newspaper = The Jakarta Post\n| access-date = 16 June 2013\n| archive-date = 26 July 2009\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090726163452/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/03/venezuela-ri-celebrate-50-years-friendly-ties.html\n| url-status = live\n}}</ref>\n* Indonesia supports Venezuela in the [[Guyana–Venezuela territorial dispute]].<ref name=\"JakartaPost1\" />\n* both countries agreed to expand the trade and investment relations, especially in [[tourism]], technology, chemicals and [[natural gas]] sectors.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Venezuela, RI to improve trade, investment relations\n| url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/04/14/venezuela-ri-improve-trade-investment-relations.html\n| date = 14 April 2010 <!-- , 2:42 PM -->\n| newspaper = The Jakarta Post\n| access-date = 16 June 2013\n| archive-date = 9 April 2023\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230409163653/https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/04/14/venezuela-ri-improve-trade-investment-relations.html\n| url-status = live\n}}</ref>\n* Indonesia has an embassy in [[Caracas]], while Venezuela has an embassy in Jakarta.\n* Indonesia and Venezuela are partners in multilateral organisations such as the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]] and [[Forum of East Asia-Latin America Cooperation|FEALAC]].\n|}\n\n=== Asia ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Afghanistan|2013}}||20 May 1950||See [[Afghanistan–Indonesia relations]]\n*Afghanistan has an embassy in Jakarta.\n*Indonesia reopened its embassy in [[Kabul]] on 14 February 2022.
