In response, the Americans in 1970 stated, \"We cannot accept the assertion of a Canadian claim that the Arctic waters are internal waters of Canada.... Such acceptance would jeopardize the freedom of navigation essential for United States naval activities worldwide.\" A compromise was reached in 1988, by an agreement on \"Arctic Cooperation,\" which pledges that voyages of American icebreakers \"will be undertaken with the consent of the Government of Canada.\"  However the agreement did not alter either country's basic legal position.  Essentially, the Americans agreed to ask for the consent of the Government of Canada without conceding that they were obliged to.
