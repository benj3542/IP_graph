"{{Short description|none}}\n<!-- \"none\" is preferred when the title is sufficiently descriptive; see [[WP:SDNONE]] -->\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2024}}\n{{Politics of Greece}}\n\nAs one of the oldest Euro-Atlantic member states in the region of Southeast Europe, Greece enjoys a prominent geopolitical role as a [[middle power]], due to its political and geographical proximity to [[Europe]]. Greece maintains strong relations with the [[Greece–United States relations|United States]], the [[Greece–United Kingdom relations|United Kingdom]], [[France–Greece relations|France]], [[Greece–Italy relations|Italy]], [[Cyprus–Greece relations|Cyprus]] and the rest of the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]], [[Lebanon]], the [[Greece-United Arab Emirates relations|United Arab Emirates]], [[Greece-North Macedonia relations|North Macedonia]], [[Greece-Albania relations|Albania]], [[Greece-Australia relations|Australia]], [[Greece-Armenia relations|Armenia]], [[Greece-Saudi Arabia relations|Saudi Arabia]], [[Greece–Serbia relations|Serbia]], [[Greece-Switzerland relations|Switzerland]] while at the same time focuses at improving further the good relations with the [[Arab World]], [[Caucasus]], [[China–Greece relations|China]], [[Greece–India relations|India]], [[Greece–South Korea relations|South Korea]], [[Greece-Japan relations|Japan]], [[Foreign relations of Mongolia|Mongolia]], [[Greece-Vietnam relations|Vietnam]], [[Greece-Philippines relations|The Philippines]], [[Greece-South Africa relations|South Africa]], and the rest of the [[African Union]], [[Arab League]], [[BRICS]], [[CELAC]] and [[Nordic Council]]. As member of the [[European Union]], the [[Union for the Mediterranean]], and the [[Council of Europe]], Greece is a key player in the eastern Mediterranean region and has encouraged the collaboration between neighbors, as well as promoting the [[Energy Triangle]], for gas exports to Europe. Greece also has the largest economy in the [[Balkans]], where it is an important regional investor.\n\nProminent issues in Hellenic foreign policy include the [[Aegean dispute|claims in the Aegean Sea]] and Eastern Mediterranean by [[Greece–Turkey relations|Turkey]] and the [[Turkish Invasion of Cyprus|Turkish occupation of Cyprus]].\n\n== Overview ==\nGreece has diplomatic relations with almost all the countries in the world, as shown in the map below.\n[[File:Foreign relations of Greece.svg|center|700px|border]]\n\n{{center|Representation through:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/el-GR/Services/Directory/GreekAuthoritiesAbroad/#Β |title=Αρχές του Εξωτερικού (Missions Abroad) |work=Hellenic Republic Ministry of Foreign Affairs |language=el |publisher=mfa.gr |access-date=2 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521050219/http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/el-GR/Services/Directory/GreekAuthoritiesAbroad/#Β |archive-date=21 May 2011 }}</ref> <small>{{Color box|#3771c8|border=darkgray}}</small> embassy – <small>{{Color box|#aaccff|border=darkgray}}</small> Greek embassy in another country<br /><small>{{Color box|#37c837|border=darkgray}}</small> general consulate – <small>{{Color box|#cccccc|border=darkgray}}</small> no representation – <small>{{Color box|black|border=darkgray}}</small> Greece}}\n\n== Disputes ==\nFollowing the resolution of the [[Macedonia naming dispute]] with [[North Macedonia]] due to the [[Prespa agreement]] in 2018, the Ministry identifies two remaining issues of particular importance to the Greek state: [[Aegean dispute|Turkish challenges to Greek sovereignty rights]] in the Aegean Sea and corresponding airspace and the [[Cyprus dispute]] involving the [[Turkish military forces in Northern Cyprus|Turkish occupation]] of Northern Cyprus.\n\n=== Cyprus dispute ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\n{{Main|Cyprus dispute}}\n[[File:Cyprus districts named.png|thumb|350px|A map of divided Cyprus.]]\n[[File:Embassy of Greece in central Nicosia Republic of Cyprus.jpg|thumb|left|Embassy of Greece in [[Nicosia]], Cyprus]]\n\nAs the island of Cyprus was heading towards independence from the United Kingdom the Greek (82%) and Turkish (18%) communities became embroiled in bitter inter-communal fighting, partly sponsored by the two \"motherlands\". [[EOKA-B]] and the [[Turkish Resistance Organization]] (TMT) were responsible for many atrocities which resulted in cementing tensions and led to total isolation of the communities with Turkish Cypriots withdrawn into [[Turkish Cypriot enclaves|enclaves]].\n\nIn 1974, the US-backed Greek junta –took power during November 1973 by overthrowing the previous junta – partly in a move to draw attention away from internal turmoil and partly unsatisfied with Makarios' policy in Cyprus, on 15 July attempted a coup to replace him with Nikos Sampson and declare union with Greece. Seven days later, Turkey launched an invasion of Cyprus allegedly to reinstate the constitution but which resulted in blooded conflict, partition of the island and mass ethnic cleansing. The overwhelming Turkish land, naval and air superiority against island's weak defenses led to the bringing of 37% of the land under Turkish control.\n\n170,000 Greek Cypriots were evicted from their homes in the north with 50,000 Turks following the opposite path concluding the de facto division of Cyprus. In 1983 Turkish Cypriots proclaimed independence unilaterally with only Turkey recognizing them. As of today the north is under an embargo as a measure against the illegal partition of the island.\n\nEver since both countries along with the two communities of the island are engages into a [[vicious cycle]] of negotiations which led to little. In 2004 the [[Annan Plan]] for Cyprus was put to vote but whilst it was accepted by the north, it was rejected by the Greek-Cypriots as it meant in their eyes, endorsing a confederal state with a weak central government and considerable local autonomy. The Republic of Cyprus is a constitutional democracy which has reached great levels of prosperity, with a booming economy and good infrastructures, part of the United Nations, [[European Union]] and several others organizations by whom it is recognized as the sole legitimate government of the whole island.\n\nGreece calls for the removal of Turkish troops from Cyprus and the restoration of a unified state. The Republic of Cyprus is receiving strong support from Greece in international forums with the latter maintaining a military contingent on the island, and Greek officers filling key positions in the [[Cypriot National Guard]].\n\n=== Aegean claims by Turkey ===\n{{Main|Aegean dispute}}\n\nOther issues dividing Greece and Turkey involve the delimitation of the [[continental shelf]] in the Aegean Sea, territorial waters and airspace. In March 1987 a dispute concerning [[oil drilling]] rights, almost led to war between the countries with Greece advocating the dispute to be decided by the [[International Court of Justice]]. In early 1988, the Turkish and Greek Prime Ministers met at [[Davos, Switzerland]], and later in [[Brussels]]. They agreed on various measures to reduce bilateral tensions and to encourage cooperation.\n\nTensions over the Aegean Sea surfaced again in November 1994, when Greece claimed under the [[Law of the Sea Treaty]], which Turkey has not signed, that it reserved the right to declare an expansion of its [[continental shelf]] from {{convert|6|to(-)|12|nmi|0|lk=in}} around its Aegean islands. Turkey which has itself expanded its continental shelf in the [[Black Sea]] shore, stated that it would consider any such action a cause for war. New technical-level bilateral discussions began in 1994 but soon fizzled-out.\n\nIn January 1996, Greece and Turkey came close to an armed confrontation over the question of which country had sovereignty over an [[Imia-Kardak crisis|islet in the Aegean]]. In July 1997, on the sidelines of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]]) summit in Madrid, Greek and Turkish leaders reached agreement on six principles to govern their bilateral relations. Within a few months, however, the two countries were again at odds over Aegean airspace and sovereignty issues. Tensions remained high for months, although various confidence-building measures were discussed to reduce the risk of military accidents or conflict in the Aegean, under the auspices of the NATO Secretary General.\n\n=== Turkey and the EU ===\n{{Main|Accession of Turkey to the European Union|European Union–Turkey relations}}\nGreece has come out in support of Turkey's bid for [[European Union]] membership,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.ethesis.net/greece/greece.htm#Conclusion\n|access-date=14 August 2008\n|title=Greece's Shifting Position on Turkish Accession to the EU Before and After Helsinki (1999)\n|author=Lucas, Dimitrios\n|date=4 January 2006\n|work=MA in European Studies\n|publisher=Catholic University of Leuven\n|quote=[Greece has become] one of Turkey's most ardent supporters within the EU.\n}}</ref> and supports its full integration to the union when conditions for its acceptance are met.

Mesut Yılmaz's admission sparked political outrage in Greece on Monday, causing Greece's Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoris Delavekouras to say that the claims were \"serious and must be investigated,\" adding that Athens was awaiting a briefing from Ankara. Conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]]'s shadow foreign minister Panos Panayiotopoulos said the revelations \"cast heavy shadows over [[Greek–Turkish relations]]\" and called on Turkey recompense Greece for losses incurred.<ref>[http://www.birgun.net/politics_index.php?news_code=1324643597&year=2011&month=12&day=23 Mesut Yilmaz told BirGün about the dark years] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718133827/http://www.birgun.net/politics_index.php?news_code=1324643597&year=2011&month=12&day=23 |date=18 July 2013 }}, BirGün, Monday 23 December 2011 (in Turkish)</ref><ref>[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_26/12/2011_419985 Former Turkish PM's arson admission fuels anger], [[Kathimerini]], Tuesday 27 December 2011</ref>\n\nFollowing an official complaint from Greece on 24 December seeking clarification over comments by former Prime Minister Mesut Yılmaz relating to forest fires in Greece in the mid-1990s, the Greek and Turkish foreign ministers, [[Stavros Dimas]] and [[Ahmet Davutoğlu]], spoke on Wednesday 28 December. Dimas stressed how important it was that Ankara investigate the claims that in the past Turkey's intelligence services paid arsonists to set fire to forests in Greece. In addition to Greek Foreign Ministry meetings with Turkish officials, Greece's Supreme Court prosecutor Yiannis Tentes launched an emergency inquiry on 27 December, ordering the investigations into the mid-1990s wildfires blamed on arson to be reopened with regard to the initial claims reportedly made by Yılmaz.<ref>[http://www.todayszaman.com/news-267033-greece-demands-official-response-from-ankara-on-forest-fires.html Greece demands official response from Ankara on forest fires] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231015756/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-267033-greece-demands-official-response-from-ankara-on-forest-fires.html |date=31 December 2011 }}, ''[[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman]]'', Wednesday 28 December 2011</ref>\n\nFormer head of [[National Intelligence Service (Greece)|Greek intelligence service]] [[Leonidas Vasilikopoulos]] said they had received information from their agents in Turkey that Turkish agents or others were involved in the forest fires on Greek islands.<ref>[http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/129031/turk-greek-ties-strained-by-arson-row.html Turk-Greek Ties Strained by Arson Row] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531105739/http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/129031/turk-greek-ties-strained-by-arson-row.html |date=31 May 2014 }}, ''[[Journal of Turkish Weekly]]'', Friday 30 December 2011</ref> After making the comments in Turkish daily newspaper ''BirGün'', Yilmaz said that his words had been distorted and that he was referring to Greek agents causing fires in Turkey.<ref>[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_29/12/2011_420268 Greek, Turkish foreign ministers discuss fire comment], ''[[Kathimerini]]'', Saturday 31 December 2011</ref> However, on Thursday 29, Turkish daily ''Milliyet'' published an article referring to a secret report that seemed to support claims made in the interview by Mesut Yılmaz that secret agents had caused forest fires in Greece in the 1990s. According to ''Milliyet'', an associate of Yılmaz's, Kutlu Savas, compiled a 12-page report that detailed the actions of Turkish agents in Greece. It described how the [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|National Intelligence Organization of Turkey]] (MIT) had formed two teams: one which carried out bombings at tourist sites on [[Crete]] and other parts of Greece and another which was responsible for starting the wildfires. An attack on an army camp in [[Lamia (city)|Lamia]], central Greece, is also mentioned.<ref>[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_29/12/2011_420375 Turkish daily cites report supporting wildfire claims], [[Kathimerini]], Saturday 31 December 2011</ref>\n\n== Diplomatic relations ==\nList of countries which Greece maintains diplomatic relations with:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |[[File:Diplomatic relations of Greece.svg|frameless|425x425px]]\n|-\n!#\n!Country\n!Date\n|-\n|1 || {{flag|United Kingdom}}||{{dts|21 November 1828}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=Greece liberated |url=https://200years.mfa.gr/en/diplomatic-consular-relations-en/united-kingdom/ |access-date=2 February 2025 |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Greece]]}}</ref>\n|-\n|2\n|{{flag|Sweden}}\n|{{dts|5 February 1833}}<ref name=\"auto11\">{{Cite web |title=Greece Liberated: Kingdom of Sweden and Norway |url=https://200years.mfa.gr/en/diplomatic-consular-relations-en/sweden-norway/ |access-date=6 November 2023 |website=Hellenic Republic Ministry of Foreign Affairs Service of Diplomatic & Historical Archives}}</ref>\n|-\n|3 || {{Flag|France}}||{{Dts|19 February 1833}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=Greece liberated |url=https://200years.mfa.gr/en/diplomatic-consular-relations-en/france/ |access-date=9 March 2022}}</ref>\n|-\n|4 || {{Flag|Portugal}}||{{dts|22 July 1835}}<ref name=\":123\">{{Cite web |title=GREECE LIBERATED.

Diplomatic & Historical Archives}}</ref>\n\nAfter more than a century of strained relations and intermittent fighting, Greece and Turkey agreed under the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] to a [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|population exchange]] as an attempt to reduce tensions between the two countries in the future. A significant 300,000 strong Greek community in [[Istanbul]] and a 100,000 Turk one in [[Western Thrace]] were excluded from the transfer, with each one supposed to be working as counter-weights to any anti-minority policy that either Turkey or Greece may sought to apply in the future, however that counter-weight came to an end before the Cyprus dispute because of the Varlik Vergisi and Istanbul pogrom.\n\nIn 1942 a wealth tax called the [[Varlık Vergisi]] was imposed on non-Muslims including Greeks, this resulted in financial ruin for many Greeks and another exodus of Greeks from Anatolia once World War II had come to an end. Again in 1955 an anti-Greek [[Istanbul pogrom]] was initiated by Turkish mobs against the Greek community of Istanbul, which led to the final gradual extinction of the Greek community in Anatolia. These two events were a major factor when the [[Cyprus problem]] surfaced as Greece and Turkey nearly came to a full-out war after Turkey's invasion of Cyprus. Similar disputes occurred for the islands of [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]]. Up to late 1990s strained relations almost led to [[Imia crisis|an open war]] in 1974, 1987 and 1996. Since the [[Greek-Turkish earthquake diplomacy|earthquake diplomacy]] in 1999 relations have once again begun improving. \n* Greece has an embassy in [[Ankara]] and a consulates-general in [[Istanbul]] and [[İzmir]] and consulate in [[Edirne]].\n* Turkey has an embassy in Athens and consulates-general in [[Piraeus]], [[Rhodes]] and [[Thessaloniki]]. \n* Both countries are full members of the Council of Europe and of NATO.\n* Greece opposes [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkey's EU membership]].\n|--valign=\"top\"\n| {{Flag|United Arab Emirates}}||<!-- date relations started-->1971\n|See [[Greece–United Arab Emirates relations]]\n* Greece opened an embassy in [[Abu Dhabi]] in 1989.

During rule of dictator [[Enver Hoxha]] relations were strained because of the part that Albania played during [[World War II]] against Greece and also because of the material help that they provided to Greek communists during the [[Greek civil war]]. In addition there was controversy about the treatment of the Greek minority in southern Albania, the historic region of [[Northern Epirus]] and the [[Chameria|Cham issue]].\n\nFollowing the collapse of communism in Albania, relations between the two countries improved with periods of destabilisation due to accusations of mistreatments of minorities in each country. Illegal immigration from Albania and complaints of the Greek minority in Albania regarding treatment by state authorities led to issues at the socio-political level. Greece, which didn't experience high levels of immigration at the time, faced increased criminality by illegal immigrants and ethnic Albanians faced police brutality. According to official Greek data, 450,000 Albanians, including Greeks from Albania, migrated to Greece.

Under Greek pressure, the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]] agreed that for the Republic of Macedonia to receive an invitation to join these institutions the name dispute must be resolved first.<ref name=\"NATO summit\">{{cite web |url=http://www.summitbucharest.ro/en/doc_202.html |title=Bucharest Summit Declaration Issued by the Heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Bucharest on 3 April 2008 |date=3 April 2008 |publisher=summitbucharest.ro |access-date=27 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003162137/http://www.summitbucharest.ro/en/doc_202.html |archive-date=3 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"EU Accession\">{{CELEX|32008D0212|text=2008/212/EC: Council Decision of 18 February 2008 on the principles, priorities and conditions contained in the Accession Partnership with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and repealing Decision 2006/57/EC}}</ref><ref name=\"EU Accession 2\">{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/key_documents/2010/package/conclusions_fyrom_en.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122112633/http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/key_documents/2010/package/conclusions_fyrom_en.pdf |archive-date=2010-11-22 |url-status=live |title=Conclusions on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia |publisher=ec.europa.eu |access-date=27 August 2011}}</ref> This resulted in a case at the [[International Court of Justice]] against Greece for violation of the Interim Accord.<ref name=\"ICJ 1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/142/14881.pdf |title=The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia institutes proceedings against Greece for a violation of Article 11 of the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995 |date=17 November 2008 |publisher=icj-cij.org |access-date=27 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216072534/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/142/14881.pdf |archive-date=16 December 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Court deemed Greece was wrong to block its neighbour's bid to join [[NATO]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16032198|title=ICJ rules Greece 'wrong' to block Macedonia's Nato bid|publisher=BBC News|date=5 December 2011|access-date=20 February 2015}}</ref> No penalties were imposed<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/142/16841.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111081617/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/142/16841.pdf#view=FitH&pagemode=none&search=%22Macedonia%22 |archive-date=11 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> but the result made it politically more difficult for Greece to object to any of its neighbour's future applications to either NATO or the EU.\n\nOn 12 June 2018 the [[Prespes agreement]] was signed between the two countries which changed the constitutional name of \"Macedonia\" to [[Republic of North Macedonia]]. Opposition arose in both countries but in the end the agreement was mutually ratified. The Prespes agreement went into force 12 February 2019. Greece officially endorsed North Macedonia's accession to NATO on 15 February 2019, being the first country in the defense alliance to do so.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2019-01-25 |title=Macedonia and Greece: Vote settles 27-year name dispute |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47002865 |access-date=2024-03-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Northern Epirus ===\n{{Main|Northern Epirus}}\nNorthern Epirus is the name used generally by Greeks to refer to the southern part of Albania, home to a Greek minority<ref>Country Studies US: [http://countrystudies.us/albania/49.htm Greeks and Other Minorities]</ref> which after 1989 keeps reducing due to immigration to Greece. The Greek minority was subject to oppression and harassment during [[Enver Hoxha]]'s communist rule and along with the rest of Albanians was hit hardly by the isolation that the regime imposed and from the economic hardship that followed the [[fall of communism]] as well. The treatment of the minority by the Albanian government is strongly linked with the status of Greco-Albanian relations.\n\nThe Greek minority is organized under the [[Unity for Human Rights Party]] which is the continuation of the former banned party called \"Omonoia\" (Unity in Greek) and has since 1997 joined the [[Socialist Party of Albania|Socialist coalition]]. At the [[1996 Albanian parliamentary election|1996 Albanian election]] the Greek minority party received 4.1% of the vote and two seats in parliament. The party leader is Vangjel Dule, while party member Vasilis Bolanos is former mayor of the town of Himara. The party is represented in the ELDR group in the Council of Europe. Strong Greek presence exists in [[Gjirokastër]], [[Korçë]], [[Sarandë]], [[Himara]] and the nearby areas. The former CIA director [[George J. Tenet]], [[Pyrros Dimas]], [[Sotiris Ninis]] and former Greek president [[Kostis Stefanopoulos]] have ancestral links to the Greek minority.\n\nThe situation of the [[Greeks in Albania]] is closely tied to the socio-political ties of the two countries. At times differences between Athens and Tirana regarding the rights and position of the minority has led to tense relations. The community, alongside the [[Albanian communities in Greece]] are hailed as a bridge of friendship between the two countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=Greek PM Mitsotakis Pledges to Steadfastly Support Ethnic Greek Minority of Albania |url=https://www.thenationalherald.com/greece-unhappy-albania-makes-deal-to-buy-war-drones-from-turkey/ |website=The National Herald |date=22 December 2022 |quote=\"...Mitsotakis, clearly moved, stated that it was a great honour to be the first Greek prime minister to visit Himare... \"The Greek ethnic minority of Albania will have in me a steadfast supporter of your just claims.

Moreover, the biggest part of the Patriarchate's property – known as Vakoufia – had been confiscated by Turkish authorities and the [[Halki seminary|Theological school of Halki]], the traditional school out of which the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] draws its clergy, has been closed since 1971. To no avail numerous Greek, European Union and USA officials have criticized Turkey's attitude and even president [[Bill Clinton]] during his visit in Greece asked for the theological school to open. During Greek prime-minister's [[Kostas Karamanlis]] historic visit to Turkey in 2007, [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] promised to reconsider his country's stance on the matter.\n\n=== Black Sea ===\nThe [[Black Sea]] is a region heavily colonized by Greeks throughout history. It used to have a [[Pontic Greeks|significant presence of Greeks]] up until the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] in 1923. Nowadays there remains Greek presence on the shores of Black Sea mainly in [[Mariupol]] (Ukraine), [[Crimea]], Russia and Georgia despite emigration to Greece during and after the dissolution of [[Soviet Union]]. Today Greeks in the region are estimated to be around 215,000 according to official [[Greek diaspora]] figures. Greece is a founding member of the [[Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation]].\n\n== International organization participation ==\nGreece is a major participant in most large-scale international bodies, with the geographic significance of the region proving advantageous for diplomatic, trade and political crossroads.\n\nIn 1967, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands brought the [[Greek Case]] against the [[Greek junta]] regime for human rights violations. As a result, Greece left the [[Council of Europe]] in 1969, returning in 1976. It was the only country to have left the Council of Europe up until 2022 when Russia also left.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Madsen |first1=Mikael Rask |title=Principled Resistance to ECtHR Judgments – A New Paradigm? |date=2019 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-662-58986-1 |pages=35–52 |chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-58986-1_2|chapter=Resistance to the European Court of Human Rights: The Institutional and Sociological Consequences of Principled Resistance|series=Beiträge zum ausländischen öffentlichen Recht und Völkerrecht |volume=285 |doi=10.1007/978-3-662-58986-1_2 |s2cid=210655765 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Bates |first1=Ed |title=The Evolution of the European Convention on Human Rights: From Its Inception to the Creation of a Permanent Court of Human Rights |date=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-920799-2 |pages=264–270|chapter=The 'Greek' Case, 1967–1969}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Welle (www.dw.com) |first=Deutsche |title=What does Russia leaving the Council of Europe mean? {{!}} DW {{!}} 17 March 2022 |url=https://www.dw.com/en/what-does-russia-leaving-the-council-of-europe-mean/a-61164543 |access-date=2022-04-04 |website=Deutsche Welle}}</ref>\n\n[[Bank for International Settlements|BIS]], [[Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation|BSEC]], [[Customs Cooperation Council|CCC]], [[Council of Europe|CE]], [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council|EAPC]], [[EBRD]], [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa|ECA]] (associate), [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|ECE]], [[ECLAC]], [[European Investment Bank|EIB]], [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|EMU]], EU, [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], [[IAEA]], [[IBRD]], [[ICAO]], [[International Development Association|IDA]], [[International Energy Agency|IEA]], [[IFAD]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[International Maritime Organization]], [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]], [[IOC]], [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[NATO]], [[OECD]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], [[The United Nations|UN]], [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]], [[UNCTAD]], [[UNESCO]], [[UNHCR]], [[WEU]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[WIPO]], [[Craiova Group]] [[WMO]].\n\nGreece was elected by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to the [[United Nations Security Council]], on 15 October 2004, as a non-permanent member for 2005 and 2006.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of diplomatic missions in Greece]]\n* [[List of diplomatic missions of Greece]]\n* [[List of ministries of Greece]]\n* [[Foreign relations of the European Union]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Cite journal |last=Economides |first=Spyros |date=March 2005 |title=The Europeanisation of Greek Foreign Policy |journal=[[West European Politics]] |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=471–491 |doi=10.1080/01402380500060528 |s2cid=154004940}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|International relations of Greece|Foreign relations of Greece}}\n* [http://www.ypex.gov.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/ Greece's foreign policy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928135304/http://www.ypex.gov.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/ |date=28 September 2007 }}, via the Greek Ministry of Foreign affairs\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051220072011/http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/al.html#People Ethnic groups in Albania], via CIA – The World Factbook\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120716202721/http://www2.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic+Regions/South-Eastern+Europe/Turkey/ Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs]\n\n{{Hellenic foreign relations}}\n{{Greece topics}}\n{{Foreign relations of Europe}}\n\n[[Category:Foreign relations of Greece| ]]"
