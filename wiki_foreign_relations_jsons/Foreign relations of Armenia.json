The [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] voted to secede from Azerbaijan and join Armenia. Soon, violence broke out against Armenians in Azerbaijan and Azeris in Armenia. In 1990, after violent episodes in Nagorno–Karabakh and Azerbaijani cities like [[Baku]], [[Sumgait]] and [[Kirovabad]], Moscow declared a state of emergency in Karabakh, sending troops to the region, and [[Black January|forcibly occupied Baku]], killing over a hundred civilians. In April 1991, Azerbaijani militia and Soviet forces targeted Armenian populations in Karabakh, known as [[Operation Ring]]. Moscow also deployed troops to [[Yerevan]]. Following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], conflict escalated into a full-scale war between the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (supported by Armenia), and Azerbaijan. Military action was influenced by the Russian military, which manipulated the rivalry between the two neighbouring sides in order to keep both under control.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nMore than 30,000 people were killed in the fighting during the period of 1988 to 1994. In May 1992, Armenian forces seized [[Shusha]] and [[Lachin]] (thereby linking Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia). By October 1993, Armenian forces succeeded in taking almost all of former NKAO, Lachin and large areas in southwestern Azerbaijan. In 1993, the [[UN Security Council]] adopted [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions on the Nagorno-Karabakh War|four resolutions]] calling for the cessation of hostilities, unimpeded access for international humanitarian relief efforts, and the eventual deployment of a peacekeeping force in the region. Fighting continued, however, until May 1994 at which time Russia brokered a cease-fire between the three sides.\n\nNegotiations to resolve the conflict peacefully have been ongoing since 1992 under the [[OSCE Minsk Group|Minsk Group]] of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]. The Minsk Group is co-chaired by Russia, France, and the United States and has representation from Turkey, the U.S., several European nations, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Despite the 1994 cease-fire, sporadic violations, [[sniper]]-fire and [[land mine]] incidents continue to claim over 100 lives each year.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XMF3DAAAQBAJ&q=Negotiations+to+resolve+the+conflict+peacefully+have+been+ongoing+since+1992+under+the+aegis+of+the+Minsk+Group+of+the+Organization+for+Security+and+Co-operation+in+Europe.+The+Minsk+Group+is+co-chaired+by+Russia%2C+France%2C+and+the+United+States+and+has+representation+from+Turkey%2C+the+U.S.%2C+several+European+nations%2C+Armenia+and+Azerbaijan.+Despite+the+1994+cease-fire%2C+sporadic+violations%2C+sniper-fire+and+landmine+incidents+continue+to+claim+over+100+lives+each+year.%5B&pg=PA32|title=Azerbaijan Business and Investment Opportunities Yearbook Volume 1 Strategic, Practical Information and Opportunities|date=14 April 2016|publisher=IBP Inc|isbn=978-1-4387-7619-4|language=en|access-date=27 November 2020|archive-date=7 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230407231043/https://books.google.com/books?id=XMF3DAAAQBAJ&q=Negotiations+to+resolve+the+conflict+peacefully+have+been+ongoing+since+1992+under+the+aegis+of+the+Minsk+Group+of+the+Organization+for+Security+and+Co-operation+in+Europe.+The+Minsk+Group+is+co-chaired+by+Russia,+France,+and+the+United+States+and+has+representation+from+Turkey,+the+U.S.,+several+European+nations,+Armenia+and+Azerbaijan.+Despite+the+1994+cease-fire,+sporadic+violations,+sniper-fire+and+landmine+incidents+continue+to+claim+over+100+lives+each+year.&#91;&pg=PA32|url-status=live}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}\n\nSince 1997, the Minsk Group co-chairs have presented three proposals to serve as a framework for resolving the conflict. Each proposal was rejected. Beginning in 1999, the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia initiated a direct dialogue through a series of face-to-face meetings, often facilitated by the Minsk Group Co-Chairs. The OSCE sponsored a round of negotiations between the presidents in [[Key West]], Florida. U.S. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] launched the talks on 3 April 2001, and the negotiations continued with mediation by the U.S., Russia and France until 6 April 2001. The Co-Chairs are still continuing to work with the two presidents in the hope of finding lasting peace.\n\nThe two countries were technically still at war until 2025. Citizens of Armenia, as well as citizens of any other country who are of [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian descent]], are forbidden entry to Azerbaijan. If a person's passport shows evidence of travel to Nagorno–Karabakh, they are forbidden entry to Azerbaijan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsj.org/Azerbaijan.shtml |title=Azerbaijan Country Page of the ''NCSJ'' (advocates on behalf of Jews in Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic States & Eurasia) accessed 23 May 2010 |access-date=26 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308021931/http://www.ncsj.org/Azerbaijan.shtml |archive-date=8 March 2009  }}</ref><ref name=\"panarmenian.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/world/news/25889/|title=Azerbaijan doesn't allow Armenians in the country|work=PanARMENIAN.Net|access-date=19 February 2015|archive-date=13 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713183519/http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/world/news/25889/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, in what became known as the [[2008 Mardakert Skirmishes]], Armenian forces and Azerbaijan clashed over Nagorno-Karabakh.

There are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries, because of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and dispute.{{pb}}During the Soviet period, many Armenians and Azeris lived in relative peace under the Soviet iron fist. However, when Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the policies of Glasnost and Perestroika, the majority of Armenians from the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast|Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO)]] of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan SSR]] began a movement to unify with the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian SSR]]. In 1988, the Armenians of Karabakh voted to secede and join [[Armenia]]. This, along with sporadic massacres in Azerbaijan against Armenians resulted in the conflict that became known as the [[First Nagorno-Karabakh War|Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. The violence resulted in ''de facto'' Armenian control of former NKAO and seven surrounding Azerbaijani regions which was effectively halted when the three sides agreed to observe a cease-fire which has been in effect since May 1994, and in late 1995 the sides also agreed to mediation of the OSCE Minsk Group. The Minsk Group is co-chaired by the [[United States|U.S.]], [[France]] and [[Russia]], and comprises [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkey]] and several [[Western europe during the cold war|Western European nations]]. Despite the cease fire, up to 40 clashes are reported along the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict lines of control each year.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}{{pb}}The sides are still technically at war.

Both are ancient Christian civilizations with their own distinct alphabets. Both use the terms \"Apostolic\" and \"Orthodox\" in the full titles of their respective churches. They also use the term \"Catholicos\" to refer to their church patriarchs. Despite all this, however, Armenians and Georgians have tended to have a tenuous relationship (at times, sharing close bonds while at other times regarding each other as rivals).{{pb}}Today, relations with Georgia are of particular importance for Armenia because, under the economic blockade imposed by Turkey and Azerbaijan due to the ongoing [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]], Georgia offers Armenia its only land connection with Europe and access to its [[Black Sea]] ports. However, because of Armenia's reliance on Russia and Georgia, both of whom fought the [[Russo-Georgian War|2008 South Ossetia war]] and severed diplomatic and economic relations as a result; and as 70% of Armenia's imports entered via Georgia especially from Russia which has imposed an economic blockade on Georgia, Armenia also has been indirectly affected from this blockade as well. The development of close relations between Turkey and Georgia (such as the [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline|Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline]] and [[South Caucasus Pipeline|South Caucasus natural gas pipeline]]) have also weighed on the mutual relations. For example, on 20 March 2006, Georgian Ambassador to Armenia Revaz Gachechiladze stated, <blockquote>\"We sympathize with the sister nation but taking decisions of the kind we should take into account the international situation. When the time comes Georgia will do everything within the limits of the possible for the recognition of the Armenian genocide by the international community including Georgia.\" </blockquote>However, Armenian-Georgian relations have begun to improve. On 10 May 2006, Armenia and Georgia agreed on the greater part of the lines of the state border between the two countries. The [[Javakheti-Armenian Uplands|Javakheti]] region in southern Georgia contains a large Armenian population and although there have been local civic organizations (such as United [[Javakheti|Javakhk]]) pushing for autonomy, there has been no violence between Armenians and Georgians in the area.\n* Armenia has an embassy in [[Tbilisi]] and general consulate in [[Batumi]].\n* Georgia has an embassy in [[Yerevan]].\n* There are roughly 170,000 Armenians in Georgia today.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|India}}||align=right|<!--start date --> {{dts|31 August 1992}}\n| See [[Armenia–India relations]]\n* Since 1999, Armenia has an embassy in New Delhi and two honorary consulates [[Mumbai]], and [[Chennai]].\n* India has an embassy in Yerevan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indianembassy.am/eng/main.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227100947/http://www.indianembassy.am/eng/main.html|url-status=usurped|title=indianembassy.am|archivedate=27 February 2010|website=indianembassy.am}}</ref>\n* [[Indian government]] is funding the renovation of schools in Lori region.\n* Around 700 Medical students are studying in Armenian universities.\n* Armenia recognizes [[Kashmir]] to be part of India and not of Pakistan.\n* Armenia supports India's bid for permanent seat in the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianembassy.am/relation.html |title=Armenia – India Bilateral Relations |publisher=Indianembassy.am |access-date=12 November 2011 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028080319/http://www.indianembassy.am/relation.html |archive-date=28 October 2011 }}</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Indonesia}}||align=right|<!--start date --> {{dts|22 September 1992}}\n||See [[Armenia–Indonesia relations]]\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 22 September 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.am/en/country-by-country/id/|title=Indonesia – Bilateral Relations – Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Armenia|first=Helix Consulting|last=LLC|work=MFA.am|access-date=23 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702140639/http://mfa.am/en/country-by-country/id/|archive-date=2 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Armenia has an embassy in [[Jakarta]]\n* Indonesia has an honorary consulate in Yerevan\n* Armenia's Representative to the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] is also located in Jakarta.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mfa.am/en/in-international-organizations/175|title=Association of Southeast Asian Nations – In International Organizations|website=mfa.am|access-date=8 April 2019|archive-date=8 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408183719/https://www.mfa.am/en/in-international-organizations/175|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Iran}}||align=right|<!--start date --> {{dts|9 February 1992}}\n|See [[Armenia–Iran relations]]{{pb}}Despite religious and ideological differences, relations between Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran remain cordial and Armenia and Iran are strategic partners in the region.

Despite this, for most of the 20th century and early 21st century, relations remain tense and there are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries for numerous reasons. Some bones of contention include the unresolved Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan (which has resulted in Turkey imposing a blockade on Armenia that is still in effect today), the treatment of Armenians in Turkey, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, and the Armenian claim of Turkey's holding of historic Armenian lands{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}{{dubious|date=June 2015}} (ceded to them in the [[Treaty of Kars]], a treaty which Armenia refuses to recognize to this day since it was signed between the Soviet Union and Turkey, and not between Armenia and Turkey proper). At the forefront of all disputes, however, is the issue surrounding the Armenian Genocide. The killing and deportation of between one and one-and-a-half million Armenians from the [[Ottoman Empire]] orchestrated by the [[Young Turks]] is a taboo subject in Turkey itself as the Turkish government refuses to acknowledge that a genocide ever happened. However, since Turkey has become a candidate to join the European Union, limited discussion of the event is now taking place in Turkey. Some in the European Parliament have even suggested that one of the provisions for Turkey to join the E.U. should be the full recognition of the event as genocide.{{pb}}On 5 June 2005, Armenian President Robert Kocharian announced that he was ready to \"continue dialogue with Azerbaijan for the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and with Turkey on establishing relations without any preconditions.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=18307 |title=Yerevan Ready to Continue Dialogue with Baku for Karabakh Settlement |publisher=PanArmenian.net |date=5 June 2006 |access-date=12 November 2011 |archive-date=22 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922160315/http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=18307 |url-status=live }}</ref> Armenia has also stated that as a legal successor to the [[Armenian SSR]], it is loyal to the Treaty of Kars and all agreements inherited by the former Soviet Armenian government.<ref>{{cite news | title = In Vartan Oskanian's Words, Turkey Casts Doubt on the Treaty of Kars With Its Actions | publisher = All Armenian Mass Media Association | date = 13 December 2006 | url = http://www.mediaforum.am/armtoday.php?year=2006&month=12&day=13&LangID=1 | access-date = 13 December 2006 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009175655/http://www.mediaforum.am/armtoday.php?year=2006&month=12&day=13&LangID=1 | archive-date = 9 October 2007 }}</ref> Yet Turkey continues to lay preconditions on relations, insisting that Armenia abandon its efforts to have the Genocide recognized, which official [[Yerevan]] is not willing to do.{{pb}}In the wake of the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] between Georgia and Russia, Armenia and Turkey have shown signs of an inclination to reconsider their relationship. According to ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine, 70% of Armenia's imports enter via Georgia.
