Some [[international relations]] of [[Switzerland]] are handled by other departments of the [[federal administration of Switzerland]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Original Geneva Conventions.jpg|thumb|The [[First Geneva Convention]] (1864). [[Geneva]] is the city that hosts the highest number of [[international organisation]]s in the world.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} François Modoux, \"La Suisse engagera 300 millions pour rénover le Palais des Nations\", ''[[Le Temps]]'', Friday 28 June 2013, page 9.</ref>]]\n\nArticle 54 of the [[Swiss Federal Constitution|Swiss Constitution of 1999]] declares the safeguarding of Switzerland's independence and welfare as the principal objective of Swiss foreign policy. Below this overarching goal, the Constitution specifies these foreign policy objectives:\n*alleviate need and [[poverty]] in the world;\n*promote respect for [[human rights]] and [[democracy]];\n*promote the peaceful coexistence of peoples;\n*promote preservation of [[natural resources]].\n\nThese objectives reflect the Swiss moral obligation to undertake social, economic, and humanitarian activities that contribute to [[world peace]] and prosperity. This is manifested by Swiss bilateral and multilateral diplomatic activity, assistance to developing countries, and support for the extension of [[international law]], particularly [[humanitarian law]].\n\nTraditionally, Switzerland has avoided alliances that might entail military, political, or direct economic action. Only in recent years have the Swiss broadened the scope of activities in which they feel able to participate without compromising [[Swiss neutrality|their neutrality]]. Switzerland is not a member of the [[European Union]] and joined the [[United Nations]] very late compared to its European neighbours.\n\nSwitzerland maintains diplomatic relations with almost all countries and historically has served as a [[Neutral country|neutral]] intermediary and host to major international treaty conferences. The country has no major dispute in its bilateral relations.\n\nSwitzerland (mainly [[Geneva]]) is home to many international governmental and nongovernmental organisations, including the [[International Olympic Committee]], the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and the [[European Broadcasting Union]]. One of the first international organisations, the [[Universal Postal Union]], is located in [[Bern]].\n\n===United Nations===\n[[File:ONU Geneva mainroom.jpg|thumb|Session in the [[Palace of Nations, Geneva|Palace of Nations]] in [[Geneva]] ]]\nSwitzerland, fearing that its status as a neutral country would be damaged, did not join the [[United Nations]] when it was created in 1945.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why did Switzerland only join the United Nations in 2002?|url=https://www.iamexpat.ch/expat-info/swiss-expat-news/why-did-switzerland-only-join-united-nations-2002|newspaper=IamExpat.ch|date=2022-10-24|access-date=2023-04-10}}</ref> On 10 September 2002, Switzerland became a full member of the United Nations, after a [[referendum]] supporting full membership won in a close vote six months earlier; Swiss voters had rejected membership by a 3-to-1 margin [[1986 Swiss referendums|in 1986]]. The [[2002 Swiss referendums|2002 vote]] made Switzerland the first and only country to join based on a popular vote.<ref>{{cite web|title=Switzerland and the UN: a long history|url=https://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/fdfa/fdfa/aktuell/newsuebersicht/2020/06/75-jahre-uno-charta.html|website=[[Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]]|date=2020-06-26|access-date=2023-04-11}}</ref> Conversely, on 17 May 1992, Swiss voters approved by a healthy margin (55 percent in favour) the decision to join the IMF and the World Bank. Less than two weeks later, but a full two years after the initial application, Switzerland finally became a member of the IMF on 29 May of that same year.\n\nPrior to its formal accession to the United Nations, Switzerland had maintained an observer role at the UN's [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] and its [[UN Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]]. Prior to full membership it had no right to a seat as one of the [[elected members of the UN Security Council]]. Switzerland was elected as a member of the [[United Nations Security Council]] for the period 2023–2024 on 9 June 2022. Switzerland says it intends to play its role as a \"bridge builder\".<ref name=\"SWI swissinfo.ch 2022\">{{cite web | title=Switzerland elected to UN Security Council | website=SWI swissinfo.ch | date=2022-06-09 | url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/switzerland-elected-to-un-security-council/47661050 | access-date=2022-06-09}}</ref> Other stated priorities are peace building, supporting women into the political process, minorities rights and [[human right]]s and more transparency from the Security Council.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-confirms-un-security-council-priorities/47866430 | title=Switzerland confirms UN Security Council priorities| date=31 August 2022}}</ref>\n\nSwitzerland has fully participated within many of the UN's specialised institutions, including the [[Economic Commission for Europe]], [[United Nations Environment Programme]], the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UN High Commissioner for Refugees]], [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]], [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UN Conference on Trade and Development]], [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UN Industrial Development Organization]], and the [[Universal Postal Union]].  Switzerland has also furnished military observers and medical teams to several UN operations.{{Which|date=April 2018}}\n\nSwitzerland is a party to the Statute of the [[International Court of Justice]].\n\n====Support of UN sanctions====\nThe Swiss government on 25 June 2003, eased most of the sanctions against the Republic of [[Iraq]] in accord with [[UN Security Council]] Resolution (UNSCR) 1483. The government lifted the trade [[embargo]], flight restrictions, and financial sanctions in place since August 1990. The weapons embargo and the asset freeze, the scope of which was extended, remain in force, and restrictions on the trade in Iraqi cultural goods were newly imposed. Though not a member at the time, Switzerland had joined UN sanctions against Iraq after the [[invasion of Kuwait]].\n\nSwitzerland also has joined UN economic sanctions imposed on [[Libya]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[UNITA]] ([[Angola]]), [[Liberia]], and [[Serbia]]/[[Montenegro]]. On 15 October 2003, the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]] ended the import restrictions on raw diamonds from Sierra Leone and lifted sanctions against Libya.\n\nSwitzerland in October 2000 implemented an ordinance to enforce UN sanctions against the [[Taliban]] ([[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267|UNSCR 1267]]), which it subsequently amended in April 2001 in accord with tighter UN regulations ([[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1333|UNSCR 1333]]). On 2 May 2002, the Swiss Government eased the sanctions regime in accord with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1388|UNSCR 1388]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1390|1390]], lifting the ban on the sale of [[acetic acid]] (used in drug production), [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] airlines, and Afghan diplomatic representations. The weapons embargo, travel restrictions, and financial sanctions remain in force.\n\nThe Swiss Government in November 2001 issued an ordinance declaring illegal the [[terrorism|terrorist]] organisation [[Al-Qaeda]] as well as possible successor or supporting organisations. More than 200 individuals or companies linked to international terrorism have been blacklisted to have their assets frozen. Thus far, Swiss authorities have blocked about 72 accounts totalling U.S.$22.6 million.\n\nSwitzerland is a member of many international organizations, including the [[World Trade Organization]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], [[European Free Trade Association]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], and [[International Telecommunications Satellite Organization]]. Its central bank is a member of the [[Bank for International Settlements]], based in [[Basel]].\n\nSwitzerland is an active participant in the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], its foreign minister serving as Chairman-in-Office for 1996. Switzerland also is an active participant in the major nonproliferation and export control regimes.\n\nAlthough it is surrounded by member nations, Switzerland is not a member nation of the [[European Union]]. In 1992 Swiss voters approved membership in the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]], but later that year rejected the [[European Economic Area]] agreement, which the government viewed as a first step toward European Union membership. The Swiss instead take part in the [[European single market]] and [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] through [[Switzerland–European Union relations|bilateral treaties]].\n\n===Participation in peacekeeping===\nWhile the Swiss electorate did reject a government proposition to directly deploy Swiss troops as UN [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]] (the ''Blue Helmets'') in 1994, a total of 23 Swiss personnel including police and military observers (the ''Blue Berets'') have served or are now serving for the [[United Nations]]. These dispositions are impartial, clearly defined and cover a number of UN projects around the globe.<ref>\n[http://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home/topics/peasec/peac/intpo.html International peace-keeping operations.] ''Federal Department of Foreign Affairs''. Federal Administration admin.ch. Retrieved 22 December 2013.</ref>\n\nIn 1996 Switzerland joined [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]], the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]] in 1997, and deployed [[Swiss Armed Forces|Yellow Berets]] to support the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. In June 2001, Swiss voters approved new [[legislation]] providing for the deployment of armed Swiss troops for international peacekeeping missions under UN or OSCE auspices as well as closer international cooperation in military training.\n\nSince 1999, the [[Swiss army]] is participating through SWISSCOY in the peace keeping mission of the [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR) based on [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN-resolution 1244]], with prolonged presence until 2014, after approval by the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|Swiss federal assembly]] in Spring 2011. Main duties include the supervision of civilian reconstruction efforts, monitoring and protection of patrimonial sites, military police and medical assistance.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/en/home/themen/einsaetze/peace/swisscoy.html |title=SWISSCOY (Kosovo) |access-date=2013-12-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204002631/http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/en/home/themen/einsaetze/peace/swisscoy.html |archive-date=4 December 2013 |df=dmy-all}} ''Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport''.

This reached an apex during the Second World War, when Switzerland formally undertook 219 mandates for 35 states, and represented another eight states unofficially.<ref name=schelbert>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Schelbert |first1=Leo |article=Good offices |title=Historical Dictionary of Switzerland |year=2014 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=9781442233522 |page=153}}</ref> After the Second World War, Switzerland served an additional 67 mandates for various countries, including those between Cuba and other nations in the Western Hemisphere after the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]], between Middle Eastern nations following the outbreak of the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973, and between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] prior to the formalization of relations in 1976.\n\nSwitzerland also represented Cuba in the United States between 1991 and 2015.<ref name=LT2015>\"{{cite journal | title = La voix suisse des Etats-Unis à Cuba se tait | journal = [[Le Temps]] | date = 11 September 2015 | language = fr | url = https://www.letemps.ch/monde/2015/09/11/voix-suisse-etats-unis-cuba-se-tait | issn = 1423-3967 | access-date = 17 February 2016 | archive-date = 24 January 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170124115317/https://www.letemps.ch/monde/2015/09/11/voix-suisse-etats-unis-cuba-se-tait | url-status = dead}}</ref>\n{{check quotation}}\nToday, Switzerland has seven protecting power mandates: \n* United States interests in both Cuba (until 2015) and Iran\n* Cuban interest in the United States (until 2015)\n* Iranian interests in both Canada and Egypt\n* Saudi Arabian and Iranian interests with each other (Iran and Saudi Arabia have direct diplomatic relations since August 2023)<ref>{{Cite web |last=AFP |title=Saudi embassy in Iran resumes operations following seven-year hiatus |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/saudi-embassy-in-iran-resumes-operations-following-seven-year-hiatus/ |access-date=2023-09-17 |website=timesofisrael.com}}</ref>\n* Georgian and Russian interests with each other\n\nSwitzerland played a key role in brokering a truce agreement between the [[Sudan]]ese Government and [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] for the [[Nuba Mountains]] region, signed after a week's negotiations taking place near [[Lucerne]] in January 2002.

According to the Swiss President Ignazio Cassis, the measures were \"unprecedented but consistent with Swiss neutrality\". The administration also confirmed that Switzerland would continue to offer its services to find a peaceful solution in the conflict.

While the talks took place in a friendly atmosphere, [[Alain Berset]] insisted on the traditional application of [[Swiss neutrality]] towards the sale of military hardware to Germany for use in that conflict. A number of parliamentary efforts by Swiss lawmakers to allow such sales were already rejected previously.<ref>[https://www.srf.ch/play/tv/tagesschau/video/tagesschau-vom-18-04-2023-hauptausgabe?urn=urn:srf:video:77a5ef98-25d9-412c-8666-1c95c193c408 SRF Tagesschau vom 18.4.2023] (in German).
