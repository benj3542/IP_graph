"{{Short description|none}}\n<!-- \"none\" is preferred when the title is sufficiently descriptive; see [[WP:SDNONE]] -->\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2017}}\n{{Politics of Bangladesh}}\nThe '''foreign relations of Bangladesh''' are Bangladesh's [[International relations|relationships with foreign countries]]. The [[Government of Bangladesh]]'s policies pursue a moderate [[foreign policy]] that heavily relies on multilateral diplomacy, especially at the [[United Nations]] (UN) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). Since its independence in 1971, Bangladesh has stressed its principle of \"''Friendship towards all, malice towards none''\" in dictating its diplomacy. As a member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], Bangladesh has tended to not take sides with major powers. Since the end of the [[Cold War]], Bangladesh has pursued better relations with its neighbours and other nearby states.\n\nThe Bangladeshi government has begun to implement a foreign policy that pursues regional economic integration in [[South Asia]] and aims to establish Bangladesh as a regional hub of transit trade in [[Asia]]. Bangladesh has established official diplomatic relations with most of the members of the United Nations as well as some non-UN members like [[Palestine]]. Relations with these nations are largely cordial except for some bilateral disputes with Myanmar and Pakistan. Issues with India stem from Teesta and other river water sharing and border killings.<ref name=\"economictimes.indiatimes.com\">{{cite news |date=14 June 2015 |title=Bangladesh looks to resolve Teesta water sharing treaty with India after Land Boundary Agreement deal |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/bangladesh-looks-to-resolve-teesta-water-sharing-treaty-with-india-after-land-boundary-agreement-deal/articleshow/47664870.cms |newspaper=The Economic Times |location=Mumbai}}</ref>\n\n==Policy==\nThe foreign policy of Bangladesh consists of various strategies chosen by the [[Constitution of Bangladesh|Constitution]] and government of the country to safeguard its national interests and to achieve goals from its place on the world stage.

Foreign Minister Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury served as president of the 41st UN General Assembly in 1986.\n\nIn recent years, Bangladesh has played a significant role in international [[peacekeeping]] operations. In 2021, nearly 10,000 Bangladeshi military personnel were deployed overseas on peacekeeping operations, making it the single largest contributor to the UN peacekeeping forces. Under UN auspices, Bangladeshi troops have historically served in [[Somalia]], [[Rwanda]], [[Mozambique]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Haiti]], and units are currently serving in Kuwait and [[East Timor]]. For example, Bangladesh responded quickly to US President [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1994 request for troops and police as part of the [[Operation Uphold Democracy|multinational intervention to restore democracy in Haiti]] and provided the largest non-US contingent. As of December 2021, Bangladesh is the largest provider of UN peacekeeping troops with 6,608 personnel, followed by [[Rwanda]] with 6,335 personnel.<ref>https://peacekeeping.un.org/sites/default/files/02-country_ranking_36_mar2021.pdf\n\nMarch 2021,\n\n''Contributions by Country (Ranking)''</ref>\n\n===Non-Aligned Movement===\n\n{{main|Non-Aligned Movement}}\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2022}}\n\nBangladesh was selected to provide the next chair of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) at the organization's 2001 summit, scheduled to take place in [[Dhaka]]. However, it was later decided to host the summit at an alternative venue. As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Bangladesh has adopted a principle of staying neutral in the affairs of the [[great power]]s. However, it parted from this principle by voting against [[North Korea]] at the United Nations in December 2008, under pressure from [[Japan]].\n\n===Organisation of Islamic Cooperation===\n\n{{main|OIC}} ''See also'' [[Pakistan-OIC relations#OIC role in Pakistan-Bangladesh relationship|OIC role in Pakistan-Bangladesh relationship]]\n\nIn 1974, then Prime Minister [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], led a Bangladeshi delegation team consisting of [[Kamal Hossain]], [[Enayet Karim]], [[Ataur Rahman Khan]], [[Taheruddin Thakur]], [[Tofail Ahmed]], and [[Shah Azizur Rahman]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1326/809299487_08b698b0c9_z.jpg|title=Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with Shah Azizur Rahman to his right at Lahore|access-date=8 May 2013|archive-date=25 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225214236/http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1326/809299487_08b698b0c9_z.jpg|url-status=dead}}</ref> to the international meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC, now the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]]) held in [[Lahore]]. Following this, Bangladesh was admitted as a member of OIC. In 1977, President [[Ziaur Rahman]] amended the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]], including a clause stating that \"the state shall endeavour to consolidate, preserve and strengthen fraternal relations among Muslim countries based on Islamic solidarity\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Ahamed |first=Emajuddin |year=2012 |chapter=Rahman, Shahid Ziaur |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Rahman,_Shahid_Ziaur |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> Since then, an explicit goal of Bangladeshi foreign policy has been to seek close relations with other Islamic states.

The Developing-8 is an economic alliance consisting of Islamic-majority states that focuses on development in the areas of science and technology, banking, finance, agriculture and rural development, humanitarian development, energy, the environment, health, and finance. On 14 May 2006 in Bali, Indonesia, Bangladesh was the only nation not to sign a preferential trade agreement with the other D-8 states. Bangladesh has been the incumbent chair of the Developing-8 Countries since the organization's tenth summit in Dhaka in April 2021.\n\n===Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement===\n{{Main|Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement}}\nThe Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA), formerly known as the Bangkok Agreement, was signed in 1975 under one of the major initiatives taken by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP). Seven participating states, Bangladesh, the People's Republic of China, India, Laos, Mongolia, the Republic of Korea (South Korea), and Sri Lanka are parties to the APTA. In 2005, Bangladesh signed the APTA agreement in order to enable it to reduce trade deficits between itself and other nations such as China, South Korea, and its neighbour India. The total APTA market includes around 2.9 billion people and, as of the fiscal year (FY) 2015–2016, a gross domestic product (GDP) of around $14.6 trillion [[United States dollar|USD]].<ref>Latifee, E.

Bangladesh's relationship with India has been difficult due to irrigation and land border disputes post-1976. However, Bangladesh has enjoyed a favourable relationship with India during governments formed by the Awami League in 1972 and 1996.\n\nAt the outset, India's relations with Bangladesh were strong because of India's support for independence in 1971. During the independence war, many refugees fled to India. India also intervened militarily and helped bring international attention to the issue through [[Indira Gandhi]]'s visit to Washington, D.C. Afterwards India furnished relief and reconstruction aid. India extended recognition to Bangladesh prior to the end of the war in 1971 (the second country to do so after [[Bhutan]]) and subsequently lobbied others to follow suit. India also withdrew its military from the land of Bangladesh when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman requested Indira Gandhi to do so during the latter's visit to Dhaka in 1972.<ref name=\"ds16Dec2012\">{{cite news |last=Shelley |first=Mizanur Rahman |date=16 December 2012 |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/suppliments/victory_day/2012/pg4.htm |title=Victory Day Special 2012 |work=The Daily Star |access-date=23 January 2016 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101848/http://archive.thedailystar.net/suppliments/victory_day/2012/pg4.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"ds15Dec2014\">{{cite news |last=Feroze |first=Shahriar |date=15 December 2014 |title=1971 – A Global History of the Creation of Bangladesh |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/1971-a-global-history-of-the-creation-of-bangladesh-55388 |newspaper=The Daily Star}}</ref>\n\nIndo-Bangladesh relations have been difficult since the fall of the Mujib government in August 1975<ref>{{cite news |date=22 January 2003 |title=For Bangladesh: India is causing trouble |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/01/22/edbow_ed3__2.php |newspaper=International Herald Tribune |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616200431/http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/01/22/edbow_ed3__2.php |archive-date=16 June 2008}}</ref> over issues such as the [[Tin Bigha]] corridor and access to [[Nepal]], the [[Farakka Barrage]] and water sharing, border conflicts near [[Tripura]] and the construction of a fence along most of the border which India explains as security provision against migrants, insurgents and terrorists. Bilateral relations warmed in 1996, due to a softer Indian foreign policy and the new [[Awami League]] government. A 30-year water-sharing agreement for the [[Ganges]] River was signed in December 1996, after an earlier bilateral water-sharing agreement for the Ganges River had lapsed in 1988. Both nations also have cooperated on the issue of flood warning and preparedness. The Bangladesh Government and tribal [[Insurgency|insurgents]] signed a peace accord in December 1997, which allowed for the return of tribal refugees who had fled to India, beginning in 1986, to escape violence caused by an insurgency in their homeland in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]].\n\nThere are also small pieces of land along the border region that Bangladesh is diplomatically trying to reclaim. Padua, part of Sylhet Division before 1971, has been under Indian control since the Liberation War.

Malaysia offers economic and technical assistance, trade and investment while Bangladesh offers a cheap labour workforce for areas such as construction.\n\nMalaysia is the largest [[ASEAN]] investor in Bangladesh and Malaysian companies have invested US$1.3 billion in 59 projects in 2007 in areas such as telecommunications, textiles and financial sector. However, their trade balance is overwhelmingly in Malaysia's favour.  During the 2006{{ndash}}2007 fiscal year, exports were a mere $16.9 million compared to $384.16 million in imports. Trading between the two nations are increasing especially in pharmaceutical exports with a number businesses are calling for a free trade agreement to balance out the trade deficit.\n\nMany Malaysian companies have shown a keen interest in participation in Bangladeshi infrastructure projects such as power generation, seaport development, waste disposal systems, construction of roads and highways, as well as in the service sector such as education and healthcare. Malaysia has stated their intentions to continue to contribute to positive efforts in order to promote and expand bilateral relations with Bangladesh, particularly in the trade and investment sectors. Pending projects like the Dhaka-Chittagong highway, worth $1.2 billion, power generation, port development, et cetera, will be completing using these investments.\n\nIn 2008, Malaysia and Bangladesh signed a memorandum of understanding regarding exchange of information to combat money laundering.

In 2007, Malaysia banned imports of Bangladeshi workers into the country after hundreds of them were stranded at an airport because their employers failed to collect them. There were demonstrations in Kuala Lumpur by Bangladeshi workers demanding payments and better conditions. This created a crisis in bilateral ties but the issue has been resolved thanks to the interference of the governments.

As an economic power as well as an important member of the European Union (EU), Germany is a reliable partner of Bangladesh in development co-operation. Since independence, [[Christianity in Germany|German churches]] and numerous non-governmental organisations (NGOs) made tremendous efforts to promote the social and economic development of Bangladesh. German assistance to Bangladesh is received in the form of development efforts, trade and cultural co-operation. Both countries have a long and successful bilateral relationship on most international issues. Germany always emphasises the democratic characteristics, governance issues and development process of Bangladesh.\n\nAfter establishment of diplomatic relations, the bilateral relations between the two countries began to grow steadily. Between the start of development co-operation in 1972 and the end of 2005, Bangladesh received approximately €2.3&nbsp;billion in commitments from Germany as part of bilateral financial and technical co-operation, in addition to the funds provided by the German churches and NGOs. At an intergovernmental negotiation in 2005, Bangladesh received €14&nbsp;million in new commitments from Germany. Since 1978, all German funds provided as part of government level co-operation have been in the form of non-repayable grants.\n\nBangladesh is a priority partner country of German Development Cooperation (GTZ). By an agreement between both the government adopted in May 2004, the activities of the GTZ focus on three priority areas such as healthcare including family planning, economic reform and development of the market system through promotion of private sector, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and renewable energies. Among the other ongoing projects the promotion of legal and social empowerment of women in Bangladesh is also to be mentioned. The sustainable economic development programme of GTZ in Bangladesh contributes to the competitiveness of the ready-made garments (RMG) sector, as well as other export-oriented sectors like silk, leather and jute.\n\nIn trade with Germany, Bangladesh has for years recorded a large surplus. Germany is the second largest export market of Bangladesh after the US. Bangladesh exports in Germany in 2006 amounted to €1.56&nbsp;billion as compared with Bangladesh imports in the same period of only €305&nbsp;million. About 94% of the exports from Bangladesh to Germany are RMGs and Bangladesh imports mainly comprising machinery, chemical and electrical goods, and medicines. A German-Bangladeshi investment promotion and protection agreement has been in force since 1986 and a bilateral double taxation accord since 1993. So far German direct investments in Bangladesh are almost €60&nbsp;million. The Bangladesh-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BGCCI) acts as a business platform and mediator between both the countries.\n\nThe cultural relationship of both the countries is very strong. The cultural co-operation between them is mainly channelled through the Goethe Institute that work on developing the cultural ties between both the countries by sponsoring local and German cultural activities. Bangladesh has traditional and historical connection with Germany. There is a century-old exchange between German and Bengali people. German interest in the culture of Bengal dates back to the visits to Germany by the Bengali national poet and Nobel laureate for literature Rabindranath Tagore in the 1920s and 1930s. Many Bangladeshi intellectuals take a keen and informed interest in German literature, art, architecture and philosophy. In Bangladesh Goethe Institute is the main meeting place for all those interested in Germany.\n\nGoethe-Institute Dhaka with headquarters in Munich offers a broad variety of cultural events to present the German culture in Bangladesh through its main activities by film-workshops, film-presentations, seminars and lectures on socio-political subjects as well as on aspects on contemporary arts, theatre performances, and exhibitions of German and Bangladeshi artists.\n\nBangladesh has traditional and historical connection with Germany, and both the countries enjoy closest ties. There are increasing contracts amongst German and Bangladeshi artists, primarily in the fine arts, photography/film and theatre. Bangladeshi artists have been able to exhibit in German galleries and museums. A number of visual artists from Bangladesh have also made Germany their new home. Germany continues to promote the restoration of historical monuments, archaeological research and the unique legacy of the Bengali catamarans. Since 1981, a co-operation agreement has been in place between Radio Bangladesh and Deutsche Welle (DW).\n\nThe bilateral commercial and trade interests of both the countries are continuing, although there is considerable scope for greater engagement. Bilateral relations got some momentum by several high level visits, contracts, and political and economic dialogue. In December 2000, the then head of the government of Bangladesh officially visited Germany. In February 2004, a German nine-member parliamentary delegation also visited Bangladesh.\n\nBoth Germany and Bangladesh share common views on various international issues and work together in the UN and in other international forum. They have maintained and developed close and friendly relations in a wide range of field. The two countries are harmonised together by their commitment to various sectors mutually agreed upon, which is expected to be strengthened further in future.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{Flag|Greece}}||11 March 1972||See [[Bangladesh–Greece relations]]\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 11 March 1972.<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web |title=Bilateral Relations with Greece |url=https://athens.mofa.gov.bd/en/site/page/Bilateral-Relations-with-Greece#:~:text=Bilateral%20Relations%20with%20Greece%3A,many%20regional%20and%20global%20issues. |access-date=20 January 2024 |website=Embassy of the People's Republic of Bangladesh Athens, Greece}}</ref>\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{Flag|Holy See}}||25 September 1972||See [[Bangladesh–Holy See relations]]\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 25 September 1972.<ref name=\":38\">{{Cite web |title=Diplomatic Relations Of The Holy See |url=https://holyseemission.org/contents/mission/diplomatic-relations-of-the-holy-see.php |access-date=19 January 2024 |website=Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See to the United Nations}}</ref>\n\nRelations are primarily based on the [[Roman Catholic]] community in Bangladesh who claim to have at least 221,000 adherents out of the total [[Christianity in Bangladesh|600,000 Christians]] living in the country.

During the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] Britain offered shelter to diplomats and people who escaped the conflict. The government, politicians and the media were also critical of the atrocities and shown empathy for the [[Mukti Bahini]]. On 4 February 1972 Britain recognised Bangladesh, this eventually led to recognition from other European and Commonwealth nations and Bangladesh's induction into the Commonwealth on 18 April 1972. Britain holds the largest [[Bangladeshi diaspora]] in the western world, now numbered at around 500,000, most of them can trace their ties to the region of Sylhet. Britain also holds the largest open air Asian festival in Europe called [[Baishakhi Mela]], a Bangladeshi event held in London.\n\nThere has been numerous delegation visits since Foreign Secretary [[Alec Douglas-Home]] visited Bangladesh in June 1972. The first visit by a prime minister was [[James Callaghan]] in 1978. Other prime ministers who had visited Bangladesh are [[John Major]] in a 3-day visit in January 1997 and [[Tony Blair]] in 2002. Presidents and Prime Ministers of Bangladesh such as Sheikh Mujib, Ziaur Rahman and Fakhruddin Ahmed have visited the UK.\n\nIn March 2008, Fakhruddin Ahmed had visited [[10 Downing Street|Number 10 Downing Street]] to discuss increasing British investment and co-operation in defence and trade, especially on counter-terrorism and duty-free access for LDCs.<ref>{{cite news |date=19 March 2008 |title=Bangladesh, UK to begin 'new strategic partnership' |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/story.php?nid=28475 |newspaper=The Daily Star |access-date=20 February 2015}}</ref> Britain is the largest foreign investor in Bangladesh and the third greatest export destination for Bangladeshi goods after US and Germany.\n\nAt the 7th ISS Asia Security Summit (also known as Shangri-La Dialogue) in Singapore, Bangladesh's Foreign advisor Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury met with UK's Defence Minister Des Browne at the sidelines to discuss security and defence relations between the two countries. Browne says he hoped that Bangladesh's modernising values can reach the Bangladeshi diaspora in the UK.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bangladesh-UK ties are strategic: Foreign Adviser |url=http://www.iiss.org/whats-new/iiss-in-the-press/june-2008/bangladesh-uk-ties-are-strategic-foreign-adviser/ |newspaper=New Nation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115012744/http://www.iiss.org/whats-new/iiss-in-the-press/june-2008/bangladesh-uk-ties-are-strategic-foreign-adviser/ |archive-date=15 January 2009 |access-date=20 February 2015 |via=International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS)}}</ref>\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{Flag|European Union}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Bangladesh–European Union relations]]\n|}\n\n==America==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|-\n|{{Flag|Argentina}}\n|25 May 1972\n|See [[Argentina–Bangladesh relations]]\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 25 May 1972<ref name=\":30\">{{Cite web |title=Comunicado Conjunto sobre el Establecimiento de Relaciones Diplomáticas entre la República Argentina y la República de Bangladesh. |url=https://tratados.cancilleria.gob.ar/tratado_ficha.php?id=lKGinQ== |access-date=17 September 2023 |website=Biblioteca Digital de Tratados |language=es}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{Flag|Bahamas}}\n|8 February 1985\n|Both countries established diplomatic relations on 8 February 1985<ref name=\":107\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA351816/page/n128/mode/1up?q=Bahamas+safiullah |title=DTIC ADA351816: Near East/South Asia Report |date=28 March 1985 |publisher=Defense Technical Information Center |pages=120 |access-date=19 January 2024}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{Flag|Barbados}}\n|20 February 1974\n|Both countries established diplomatic relations on 20 February 1974<ref name=\":60\">{{Cite web |title=List of countries with which Barbados has established diplomatic relations |url=https://www.foreign.gov.bb/documents/foreign-policy/22-countries-with-diplomaic-relations-with-barbados/file |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813184054/https://www.foreign.gov.bb/documents/foreign-policy/22-countries-with-diplomaic-relations-with-barbados/file |archive-date=13 August 2017 |access-date=18 January 2024 |website=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade Barbados}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{Flag|Belize}}\n|29 August 1983\n|Both countries established diplomatic relations on 29 August 1983<ref name=\":100\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/jprs-report_jprs-84588/page/137/mode/1up?q=Belize |title=Near East/South Asia Report No. 2840 |date=24 October 1983 |publisher=United States Joint Publications Research Service |pages=137 |access-date=18 January 2024}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{Flag|Bolivia}}\n|9 June 1989\n|Both countries established diplomatic relations on 9 June 1989<ref name=\":110\">{{Cite web |title=Diplomatic Relations Between Bolivia and Bangladesh as of 9 June 1989 |url=https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/1634460?ln=en |access-date=17 September 2023 |website=United Nations Digital Library| date=9 June 1990 }}</ref>\n|-\n|{{Flag|Brazil}}\n|15 May 1972\n|See [[Bangladesh–Brazil relations]]\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 15 May 1972<ref name=\":29\">{{Cite web |title=Bangladesh-Brazil diplomatic relations |url=https://brasilia.mofa.gov.bd/en/site/page/Bangladesh-Brazil-diplomatic-relations |access-date=18 January 2024 |website=Embassy of the People's Republic of Bangladesh Brasilia DF, Brazil}}</ref>\n\nBangladesh's only embassy in South America is located in Brazil.
