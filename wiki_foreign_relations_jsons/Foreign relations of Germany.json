"{{Short description|none}}\n<!-- \"none\" is preferred when the title is sufficiently descriptive; see [[WP:SDNONE]] -->\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2021}}\n{{Politics of Germany}}The [[Federal Republic of Germany]] (up until 1990 abbreviated as FRG, opposed to [[GDR]]) is a Central European country and founding member of the [[European Union]], a member of [[G4 nations|G4]], [[G7]], the [[G-20 major economies|G20]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organizations for Economic Co-operation and Development]], the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]]) and the only remaining of two former German members of the [[United Nations]]. It maintains a network of 229 diplomatic missions abroad and holds relations with more than 190 countries. As one of the world's leading industrialized countries it is recognized as a [[Great power|major power]] in European and global affairs.\n\nGermany's relations to other powers are characterized by its past and by its commitment to promote [[peace]], stability, the [[rule of law]] and [[democracy]], while it seeks a progressing integration into the European Union. The heavily [[Western world|West]]-aligned Germany inherited diplomatic relations and missions from communist [[East Germany]], which was \"Germany\" to those countries which had only relations to one of the two German states. However, due to its allegiance and [[market economy]], the perception of Germany by some of the former [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern bloc]] countries changed with Germany's reunification.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of German foreign policy}}The history of German foreign policy covers diplomatic developments and international history since the foundation of Germany in 1871.\n\nBefore 1866, [[Austrian Empire|Habsburg Austria]] and its [[German Confederation]] were the nominal leader in German affairs, but the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Hohenzollern Kingdom of Prussia]] exercised increasingly dominant influence in German affairs, owing partly to its ability to participate in German Confederation politics through its [[Electorate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg holding]], and its ability to influence trade through its [[Zollverein]] network. The question of excluding or including Austria's influence was settled by the Prussian victory in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] (also named the ''German War'' or the  ''German-German War'') in 1866, excluding the Austrian Empire from Germany. The [[unification of Germany]] was the political purpose of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71, in which the smaller German states joined behind remaining Prussia in a smashing victory over France. The [[German Empire]] was erected in 1871 by [[Otto von Bismarck]], who dominated German and indeed all of European diplomatic history until he was forced to resign in 1890.\n\nGermany's diplomatic weight increased by transitioning its economy and society from an agrarian country to Europe's second industrial powerhouse, which soon sought competition with the leading economic power of that era, [[Great Britain]]. As from 1884, Germany engaged – as the last major European power – in oversea [[colonization]], but held only few colonies for economical exploitation, leaving Germany vulnerable to the protectionist [[mercantilism]] of other colonial powers who controlled the world's market of raw materials. Germany's development and transition led to internal tensions, which [[Wilhelm II|Emperor Wilhelm II.]], infamous for his [[Hun speech]] throughout Europe and an increasing diplomatic liability, sought to hedge with naval armament and increased imperialism much to the suspicion of the other European powers, especially the [[Entente Cordiale]]. Encircled by the [[Triple Entente]], and due to the negligence of Germany's emperor and his diplomatic advisors by giving [[Austria-Hungary]] a \"blank cheque\" on treating Entente-allied Serbia for the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Ferdinand]], the Empire of Germany had to fight back its enemies in a [[World War I|war]] on multiple fronts and was cut off from international trade routes, leading to hunger and impoverishment in Europe's most populous country.\n\nGermany was defeated in the battlefield in 1918, with its riches turning to spoils for the victors. The country had neither say nor seat at the table on which the victors negotiated how Germany and its treasures would be apportioned. The [[Treaty of Versailles]] forced Germany to convey away [[Alsace–Lorraine|Alsace-Lorraine]] to [[France]], a part of East Prussia to the [[Second Polish Republic]] and to accept the occupation of major industrial areas around Germany's centers for coal and steel production in [[Silesia]] and the [[Rhine Province|Rhine province]]. When Germany was unable to fulfill the Allied demand for reparations in gold, France [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied the Ruhr valley]] to shave Germany's coal production. The [[Weimar Republic]] had to solve these crises to gain back its international stand in diplomacy, which lead Germany to joining the [[League of Nations]] in 1926.\n\nHowever, the ransack and ongoing compromisation of Germany after World War I came with a toll on its internal stability and put the republic's attempt to establish peace and order to failure and its diplomatic influence from marginal to inept. Political extremist factions from left and right put the screws on Germany's politics by rallying against the weakened republic. International indifference to the events in the defeated country only turned into cautious unease after the [[Reichstag fire]] and [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power in 1933. The newly appointed chancellor ran on a platform of revising the Treaty of Versailles by rearmament, shaking off the shackles of occupation and \"gaining room to live\" (occupation) in the East. Racial and genocidal undertones in his program were internationally ignored as the new government was able to establish the long-sought peace and order in Germany and pursued international recognition as a stabilizing power: although Hitler's government withdrew Germany's membership from the League of Nations in 1933 much to the wary of the remaining nations, Germany managed to appease the world by hosting the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games of 1936]] and presenting the world a stable, progressive and prospering country while secretly starting a [[Four Year Plan|program for rearmament]] at the same time. Shortly after the games, Germany signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] with Japan, which sought to establish a common sphere of interest between Germany and Japan and their allied countries as well. Initially the pact was directed against the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nDespite its public presentation, Germany soon would raise suspicion by its rapidly progressing military programs, which weren't overlooked by international press. With massive interference in the internal affairs of Austria, which was unable to overcome economical challenges for 20 years after the fall of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], Germany managed to annex Austria in the [[Anschluss]], reversing the resolution of the German war 70 years earlier and violating the Treaty of Versailles once again, which forbade the union of both countries. Germany tested its newly gained strength on boosting the [[Sudeten German uprising|Sudeten crisis of 1938]], as Sudeten Germans, attracted by Germany and its success, rebelled against Czechoslovak authorities. The crisis lead to the [[Munich Agreement]], the first gain in territory for Germany since World War I. However, Hitler was dissatisfied with how the crisis was solved peacefully. The [[Appeasement|policy of appeasement]] by [[Neville Chamberlain]] allowed for Hitler to violate the agreement shortly after signing it, by dissolving the Czechoslovak government and [[Occupation of Czechoslovakia (1938–1945)|occupying the rest of the country]] in 1939, followed by the wary European powers of [[France]] and [[Great Britain]] to draw a [[Red line (phrase)|red line]] for [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]. Germany signed the [[Pact of Steel]] with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], shaping with the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan before and with the [[Tripartite Pact]] later on, what will come to be the [[Axis powers|Axis alliance]].\n\nAfter signing the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] with the USSR on 24 August 1939, which led Japan to distance itself from Germany until the Tripartite Pact was signed in 1940, Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, with the declaration of war followed by Britain and France three days later. The declarations of war did little to change the outcome of the [[Blitzkrieg]] against Poland, which soon was occupied by German and Soviet forces. Less than two years later, Germany would invade the USSR under violation of the pact. The same year, the Axis-allied Japanese Empire would [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack Pearl Harbor]], and as Germany was bound to aid Japan diplomatically by the [[Tripartite Pact]], [[German declaration of war against the United States|Hitler declared war against the USA]] four days after, unintentionally ending any remaining meaningful [[Isolationism|isolationist]] opposition in the U.S. against joining the European war and changing the U.S. stance to the rest of the world to this day.\n\nThe following years, German diplomacy is occupied with supporting the war effort and keeping together the Axis alliance as well as attending to the minor Axis-allied governments in Europe, such as [[Hungary in World War II|Hungary]], [[Romania in World War II|Romania]], [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovakia]], [[Bulgaria during World War II|Bulgaria]] (all [[Warsaw Pact]] states after the Soviet Union won the war in the East) and [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] to facilitate the \"[[Final Solution]]\". As Germany found itself on the losing side over time, Germany's diplomacy lost its ability to back up the increasingly futile war effort. Only the invocation of favors and long-lasting diplomatic aid and relationships with countries like [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]], as well as their own network, enabled the escape of some Nazi high-ranks and collaborators into exile, such as [[Josef Mengele|Dr. Josef Mengele]]. The government of Germany, and therefore its diplomatic corps, ceased to exist according to the [[Allied Control Council]]'s 1st Proclamation.\n\nGermany as a state was only reestablished in August 1949 in three of the four [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation zones]], but international representation for the state was not reestablished until 15 March 1951. As a habit, chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] employed former Nazis for his administration, and for foreign affairs, he employed former [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] diplomats, which [[The Ministry and the Past|left a dark stain]] on the founding history of the newly formed ''Federal Foreign Office'' as a democratic institution. \n\nThe first years of the Bonn republic were characterized by the efforts of a second democratic Germany to rehabilitate itself in the eyes of the world. Adenauer's government decided to align West Germany with the [[Western Bloc|Western bloc]] and made controversial decisions in its early years. Only ten years after World War II has ended, his government decided to rearm Germany once again, founding the [[Bundeswehr]] in 1955 and joining the NATO, after he discarded [[Stalin Note|Stalin's attempt to negotiate reunification and neutralization of Germany]] in 1952. The years of [[History of Germany (1945–1990)|Germany's division]] and the relations of the two German states, West-German FRG and East-German GDR, to each other mirrored the grander conflict at the [[Iron Curtain]] and the two systems. Mutual distrust, exclusion and agitation against one another captured the division of the two German nations. The FRG would characterize any attempt to open diplomatic relations to \"the other German state\" [[Hallstein Doctrine|as an unfriendly act]] which would provoke the closure of the West-German diplomatic mission in the attempting country. The GDR assumed the sole right of representation for all Germans within the [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern bloc]]. However, West Germany attracted some of the communist countries to open diplomatic missions despite the risk of spurning the East-German government, as the Eastern bloc was in dire need of [[hard currency]] and its members tried to open channels to markets which would trade in such.\n\nIn the 1970s, chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] would attempt to [[Ostpolitik|ease the relations]] between the two German states to prevent future confrontations like the [[Cuban Missile Crisis|Cuba crisis]] a few years earlier, in which the world narrowly escaped a [[World War III]] and nuclear annihilation. West Germany acknowledged the borders which were established after World War II, namely the [[Oder–Neisse line]] with Poland. The chancellor's ''[[Kniefall von Warschau]]'' would mark a major pivot point in the international perception of Germany, from a defeated and criminal warmongering power to a society which collectively would feel ashamed by its past, would swear to abstain military power and dominance and to uphold peace and to seek friendly relations with the People Germany wronged in the past. The gesture found cautiously positive remarks internationally, and Willy Brandt was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize of 1971]], to this day the only German chancellor ever being awarded the prize. 1973, both East and West Germany became [[United Nations]] members.\n\nWilly Brandt's policies helped grander diplomatic efforts between the two super powers and would bear fruit shortly after his tenure, when the [[Helsinki Accords]] were signed in 1975. The Accords enabled organizations of the civil society and NGOs to assess whether the Soviet Union would abide the legally binding declarations it signed, for the rule of law, civil liberties and guarantees of property. They also lead to the arising of human rights activism in the East bloc and to media activity directed from the West towards the East. \n\n{{Blockquote|text=\"[[Leonid Brezhnev]] had looked forward, [[Anatoly Dobrynin]] recalls, to the 'publicity he would gain... when the Soviet public learned of the final settlement of the postwar boundaries for which they had sacrificed so much'... '[Instead, the Helsinki Accords] gradually became a manifesto of the dissident and liberal movement'... What this meant was that the people who lived under these [communist] systems — at least the more courageous — could claim official permission to say what they thought.\"|author=[[John Lewis Gaddis]]|title=The Cold War: A New History (2005)|source=<ref>Gaddis, John Lewis (2005). The Cold War. London: Penguin. p. 190. ISBN 978-0-141-02532-2</ref>}}\n\nEspecially for the partaking East German government, which was confident at first the Accords would denote a victory for East bloc diplomacy, the Accords would turn out to be a calamity in internal affairs. West German media, consumed by the East German population despite attempts of inhibition, informed their audience about their rights the East German government just signed off on, very much including the sensitive issue of freedom of movement, especially between the two German states which shared a fortified and dangerous-to-life border, symbolized by the [[Berlin Wall]]. Ever since the Accords have been signed, the East German government had to face increasing mail of citizens who petitioned for \"permanent departure\" to West Germany, invoking the Helsinki Accords. \n\nAs East Germany's economical situation became untenable in the 1980s, West German prime minister of [[Bavaria]], [[Franz Josef Strauss|Franz Josef Strauß]], procured a new credit line for the GDR in 1983, which (by its [[Interest rate|interest]]) would impede the economical collapse of East Germany. Combined with the growing frictions within East Germany's society and the continuous escape movement of Germans through Eastern Europe and diplomatic missions of Germany, the GDR would survive its 40th anniversary and peaceful protests by only less than a year, with the collapse of its communist government heavily quickened by negotiations of West Germany to enable the \"permanent departure\" of Germans by a non-stop train from the [[Czech Republic]] through East Germany to West Germany. The departure met intense media coverage, creating a lasting impression on both sides of the German border and forecasting the eventual fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nIn 1990, both German states with both freely elected governments, as well as the four former occupying powers, would sign an [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|agreement about Germany's future]]. The agreement became effective on 3 October of the same year, which became the [[German Unity Day]]. \n\n==Primary institutions and actors==\n\n===Federal Cabinet===\nThe three cabinet-level ministries responsible for guiding Germany's foreign policy are the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development and the [[Federal Foreign Office]]. In practice, most German federal departments play some role in shaping foreign policy in the sense that there are few policy areas left that remain outside of international jurisdiction. The bylaws of the Federal Cabinet (as delineated in Germany's Basic Law), however, assign the Federal Foreign Office a coordinating function. Accordingly, other ministries may only invite foreign guests or participate in treaty negotiations with the approval of the Federal Foreign Office.\n\n===Bundestag===\nWith respect to foreign policy, the Bundestag acts in a supervisory capacity. Each of its committees – most notably the foreign relations committee – oversees the country's foreign policy. The consent of the Bundestag (and insofar as Länder are impacted, the Bundesrat) is required to ratify foreign treaties. If a treaty legislation passes first reading, it is referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which is capable of delaying ratification and prejudice decision through its report to the Bundestag.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Reunification and West German-Soviet Relations: The Role of the Reunification Issue in the Foreign Policy of the Federal Republic of Germany, 1949–1957, with Special Attention to Policy Toward the Soviet Union|last=Feld|first=Werner|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|year=2012|isbn=9789401194082|location=The Hague}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, a full EU Committee was also created for the purpose of addressing the large flow of EU-related topics and legislation. Also, the committee has the mandate to speak on behalf of the Bundestag and represent it when deciding an EU policy position.<ref name=\"Collins-2002\">{{Cite book|title=German Policy-Making and Eastern Enlargement of the European Union During the Ko: Managing the Agenda?|last=Collins|first=Stephen|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2002|isbn=0719063280|location=Manchester, UK|pages=49}}</ref> A case in point was the committee's involvement regarding the European Union's eastern enlargement wherein the Committee on Foreign Affairs is responsible for relations with ECE states while the EU Committee is tasked with the negotiations.<ref name=\"Collins-2002\" />\n\n===NGOs===\nThere is a raft of [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] in Germany that engage foreign policy issues.  These NGOs include think-tanks (German Council on Foreign Relations), single-issue lobbying organizations (Amnesty International), as well as other organizations that promote stronger bilateral ties between Germany and other countries (Atlantic Bridge).  While the budgets and methods of NGOs are distinct, the overarching goal to persuade decision-makers to the wisdom of their own views is a shared one. In 2004, a new German governance framework, particularly on foreign and security policy areas, emerged where NGOs are integrated into actual policymaking.<ref name=\"Werner-2016\">{{Cite book|title=NGOs in Foreign Policy: Security Governance in Germany and the Netherlands|last=Werner|first=Andreas|publisher=Waxmann Verlag|year=2016|isbn=9783830934073|location=Munster, Germany|pages=19–20}}</ref> The idea is that the cooperation between state and civil society groups increases the quality of [[conflict resolution]], [[Development aid|development cooperation]] and [[humanitarian aid]] for [[Fragile States Index|fragile states]].
