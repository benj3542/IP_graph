In international forums, Afghanistan generally followed the voting patterns of Asian and African non-aligned countries. During the 1950s and 1960s, Afghanistan was able to use the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and American need for allies during the [[Cold War]] as a way to receive economic assistance from both countries. However, given that unlike the Soviet Union, the United States refused to give extensive military aid to the country, the government of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan|Daoud Khan]] developed warmer ties with the [[USSR]] while officially remaining non-aligned. Following the [[Saur Revolution|coup of April 1978]], the government under [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] developed significantly closer ties with the [[Soviet Union]] and its communist [[satellite state|satellite]]s.\n\nAfter the December 1979 Soviet invasion, Afghanistan's foreign policy mirrored that of the [[Soviet Union]]. Afghan foreign policymakers attempted, with little success, to increase their regime's low standing in the non-communist world. With the signing of the [[Geneva Accords (1988)|Geneva Accords]], President [[Mohammad Najibullah|Najibullah]] unsuccessfully sought to end the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]'s isolation within the Islamic world and in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].\n\nMost [[Western countries]], including the [[United States]], maintained small [[embassy|diplomatic missions]] in the Afghan capital [[Kabul]] during the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet occupation]]. Many countries subsequently closed their missions due to [[Afghan Civil War (1989–1992)|instability and heavy fighting in Kabul]] after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989.\n\nMany countries initially welcomed the introduction of the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban regime]], who they saw as a stabilising, law-enforcing alternative to the [[warlord]]s who had ruled the country since the fall of Najibullah's government in 1992. The [[Taliban]] soon alienated itself as knowledge of the harsh [[Sharia]] law being enforced in Taliban-controlled territories spread around the world. The brutality towards women who attempted to work, learn, or leave the house without a male escort caused outside aid to the war-torn country to be limited.\n\n=== Islamic Republic of Afghanistan ===\nFollowing the [[Operation Enduring Freedom|October 2001 American invasion]] and the [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)|Bonn Agreement]] the [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|new government]] under the leadership of [[Hamid Karzai]] started to re-establish diplomatic relationships with many countries who had held close diplomatic relations before the communist coup d'état and the subsequent civil war.\n\nThe [[Islamic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghan government]] was focused on securing continued assistance for rebuilding the economy, infrastructure, and [[military of Afghanistan|military]] of the country. It continued to maintain close ties with [[North America]], the [[European Union]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[China]], [[Russia]] and the [[Greater Middle East]] (most specifically [[Turkey]]), as well as African nations. It also sought to establish relations with more [[South American]] or Latin American nations.\n\nBefore the [[Fall of Kabul (2021)|fall of Kabul]] in 2021, the foreign relations of [[Islamic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] were handled by the nation's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], which was headed by [[Mohammad Hanif Atmar]]. He answered to, and received guidance from, the [[President of Afghanistan]].\n\n=== Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan ===\n{{Main|International relations with the Taliban}}\n{{Further|Recognition of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|List of international trips made by Amir Khan Muttaqi as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan}}\n[[File:Amir Khan Muttaqi Oct 2025 crop.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Foreign Minister [[Amir Khan Muttaqi]] in 2025|left]]\nThe Taliban gradually gained control of the country in the summer of 2021 and proclaimed the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]] on August 15, 2021. The takeover culminated with the fall of Kabul. The Taliban has had some limited contact with foreign governments and will need to develop further relations with the international community as its new [[De facto#Politics|de facto]] government goes forward.\n\nOn 20 September 2021, the new government designated [[Suhail Shaheen|Mohammad Suhail Shaheen]] as a replacement for Ghulam M Isaczai, [[Permanent Representative of Afghanistan to the United Nations]] who continues to represent the country at the UN.

Despite that, India supported the Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan. Relations deteriorated after the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (1996–2001)|Taliban]] took power in 1996. India unofficially supported the [[Northern Alliance]] minority groups against the Pakistani-backed Taliban. During the course of the hijack of [[Indian Airlines Flight 814]] in 1999, the Taliban requested recognition by India in exchange for help in negotiations. The request was not acted upon by the [[Government of India|Indian government]]. After the fall of the Taliban in late 2001, India strengthened ties with the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan by establishing consulates in most major Afghan cities.\n\nIndia had participated in multiple socio-economic reconstruction efforts, including power, roads, agricultural and educational projects. Some of these include building dozens of [[list of dams and reservoirs in Afghanistan|dams and reservoirs]], a number of hospitals or clinics, schools and government institutions. The long road from [[Bandar-Abbas]] in southern Iran to [[Highway 1 (Afghanistan)|highway 1]] in southern Afghanistan was carried out by state-owned [[Border Roads Organisation]] (BRO), the mission statement of which states that the BRO is India's \"most reputed, multifaceted, transnational, modern construction organization committed to meeting the strategic needs of the armed forces.\" The killing of a BRO employee by the neo-Taliban in 2005<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20051124/main1.htm|title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India – Main News|website=www.tribuneindia.com}}</ref> prompted the Indian authorities to dispatch approximately 200 [[Indo-Tibetan Border Police]] commandos to in 2006 to provide security for Indians working in various construction projects in Afghanistan.\n\nPolitical contacts between India and Afghanistan had increased in 2011, especially after the [[death of Osama bin Laden]] in Pakistan.

Iran supported the cause of the Afghan resistance and provided limited assistance to the ethnic [[Hazara people|Hazara]] rebel leaders who pledged loyalty to the Iranian Revolution. After the emergence of the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban]], Iran stepped up assistance to the [[Northern Alliance]] minority ethnic groups. Iran did not have any form of relations with the Taliban. In 1998, when the Taliban captured the northern Afghan city of [[Mazar-e-Sharif]], several Iranian diplomats were executed on espionage charges.\n\nSince 2002, the new Afghan government has engaged in cordial relations with both Iran and the United States, even as relations between Iran and the United States have grown strained due to American objections to Iran's [[Nuclear programme of Iran|nuclear program]].

Later, U.S. aid shifted from infrastructure projects to technical assistance programs to help develop the skills needed to build a modern economy. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] visited Kabul in December 1959, becoming the first U.S. president to travel to Afghanistan. The [[Peace Corps]] was active in Afghanistan between 1962 and 1979.

The U.S. then reduced bilateral assistance and terminated a small military training program. All remaining assistance agreements were ended after the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].\n\nFollowing the Soviet invasion, the United States supported diplomatic efforts to achieve a Soviet withdrawal. In addition, generous U.S. contributions to the refugee program in Pakistan played a major part in efforts to assist Afghans in need. U.S. efforts also included helping Afghans living inside Afghanistan. This cross-border [[humanitarian assistance]] program aimed at increasing Afghan self-sufficiency and helping Afghans resist Soviet attempts to drive civilians out of the rebel-dominated countryside. During the period of Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the U.S. provided about $3&nbsp;billion in military and economic assistance to the Afghan [[Mujahideen]]s.\n\nFollowing the [[September 11 attacks]], the United States launched an attack on the [[Taliban]] government as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]]. Following the overthrow of the Taliban, the U.S. supported the new [[Karzai administration]] and stationed 100,000 of [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)|U.S. troops in the country]]. Their aim was to help the new government of President [[Hamid Karzai]] establish authority across Afghanistan and hunt down [[Taliban insurgency|insurgent]]s that are launching attacks.\n\nThe United States was the leading nation in the rebuilding or [[reconstruction of Afghanistan]].

Medvedev in Uzbekistan 11 June 2010-13.jpeg|thumb|[[Hamid Karzai]] sitting with [[President of Russia|Russia's President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]]]]\nAfghanistan and Russia have shared a highly varied relationship from the mid-19th century to the modern day. For decades, Russia and Britain struggled for influence in Afghanistan, strategically positioned between their two empires, in what became known as \"[[The Great Game]]\". Following the 1917 [[Bolshevik Revolution]], the new Soviet Union established more cordial relations with Afghanistan, and in 1919 became the first country to recognise Afghan sovereignty.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nRelations between the two nations became complicated following the 1978 communist coup known as the [[Saur Revolution]]. The new communist [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] was highly dependent on the Soviet Union, and the Soviet support for the widely disliked communist regime, and the ensuing [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], led to a great hatred for the Soviets in much of the Afghan population. The Soviets occupied Afghanistan in the face of a bitter ten-year insurgency before withdrawing in 1989. Even following the withdrawal of Soviet forces, the Soviet Union provided massive support to the embattled DRA government, reaching a value of $3&nbsp;billion a year in 1990. However, this relationship dissolved in 1991 along with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] itself. On 13 September 1991, the Soviet government, now dominated by Boris Yeltsin, agreed with the United States on a mutual cut off of military aid to both sides in the Afghan civil war beginning on 1 January 1992. The post-coup Soviet government then attempted to develop political relations with the Afghan resistance. In mid-November it invited a delegation of the resistance's Afghanistan Interim Government (AIG) to Moscow where the Soviets agreed that a transitional government should prepare Afghanistan for national elections. The Soviets did not insist that Najibullah or his colleagues participate in the transitional process. Having been cut adrift both materially and politically, Najibullah's faction torn government began to fall apart, and the city of Kabul fell to the Mujahideen factions in April 1992.\n\nIn 2009, Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] announced that he wanted to be more involved in Afghanistan, supporting development of infrastructure and the army. This came as relations between Afghan President Karzai and American President Obama reached a low.\n* Afghanistan has an embassy in [[Moscow]].\n* Russia has an embassy in Kabul and a consulate-general in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]].\n|-\n|{{Flag|Serbia}}\n|30 December 1954\n|Both countries established diplomatic relations on 30 December 1954.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Afghanistan |url=https://www.mfa.gov.rs/en/foreign-policy/bilateral-cooperation/afghanistan |access-date=7 November 2023 |website=Republic of Serbia Ministry of Foreign Affairs}}</ref>\n* Afghanistan does not have an accreditation to Serbia.\n* Serbia is accredited to Afghanistan from its embassy in New Delhi, India.\n|-\n|{{Flag|Slovenia}}\n|20 September 2004\n|Both countries established diplomatic relations on 20 September 2004.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mojca Pristavec Đogić |date=2016 |title=Priznanja samostojne Slovenije |url=https://fotogalerija.dz-rs.si/datoteke/Publikacije/Zborniki_RN/2016/Priznanja_samostojne_Slovenije_.pdf |access-date=8 November 2023 |page=8 |language=sl |archive-date=26 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230426044554/https://fotogalerija.dz-rs.si/datoteke/Publikacije/Zborniki_RN/2016/Priznanja_samostojne_Slovenije_.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Spain}}||9 May 1950||See [[Afghanistan–Spain relations]]\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 9 May 1950.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Censo de tratados internacionales suscritos por España Indice Kwoc.

The [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] and associated agencies have undertaken a limited number of development projects. However, the UN reduced its role in Afghanistan in 1992 in the wake of fierce factional strife in and around Kabul. The [[UN Secretary General]] has designated a personal representative to head the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan (UNOCHA) and the Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA), both based in [[Islamabad]], Pakistan. Throughout the late 1990s, 2000, and 2001, the UN unsuccessfully strived to promote a peaceful settlement among the Afghan factions as well as provide humanitarian aid, this despite increasing Taliban restrictions upon UN personnel and agencies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of diplomatic missions in Afghanistan]]\n* [[List of diplomatic missions of Afghanistan]]\n* [[Visa requirements for Afghan citizens]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* {{CIA World Factbook}}\n* {{StateDept}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Adamec, Ludwig W.
