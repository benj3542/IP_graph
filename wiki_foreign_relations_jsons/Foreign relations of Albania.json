"{{Short description|none}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{Politics of Albania}}\nThe foreign relations of [[Albania]] are its relations with other governments and peoples. Foreign relations are conducted through the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Albania)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] in [[Tirana]]. The current minister is [[Elisa Spiropali]]. The current ambassador to the United Nations is [[Suela Janina]].\n\nAlbania is a sovereign country in [[Southern Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] that declared its independence on 28 November 1912. Its foreign policy has maintained a policy of complementarianism by trying to have friendly relations with all countries. Since the [[Fall of communism in Albania|collapse of Communism]] in 1990, Albania has extended its responsibilities and position in European and international affairs, supporting and establishing friendly relations with other nations around the world. \n \nThe main factors defining Albanian foreign policy consist of geopolitical location, population, economic crisis, and ties with [[Albanian diaspora]] throughout the world. It also maintains strong diplomatic relations with the [[European Union|EU]] (primarily Croatia, France, Germany, Italy) [[Balkans|Balkan]] countries (primarily Kosovo, Greece and North Macedonia), [[Arab world]], Canada, China, Turkey, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, UK and the United States.\n\nThe main objectives of the Albanian foreign policy are the [[accession of Albania to the European Union]], the [[international recognition of Kosovo]], the recognition of [[expulsion of Cham Albanians]],<ref name=\":1\">[http://www.mfa.gov.al/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=8390 Konferencë për shtyp e Ministrit të Punëve të Jashtme z.

A wave of Albanian illegal economic migrants to Greece exacerbated tensions. The crisis in Greek–Albanian relations reached its peak in late August 1994, when an Albanian court sentenced five members (a sixth member was added later) of the ethnic Greek political party ''Omonia'' to prison terms on charges of undermining the Albanian state. Greece responded by freezing all [[European Union|EU]] aid to Albania, and sealing its border with Albania. In December 1994, however, Greece began to permit limited EU aid to Albania, while Albania released two of the ''Omonia'' defendants and reduced the sentences of the remaining four. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThere are still other impending issues in the relations between the two countries, regarding many Albanian workers in Greece who have not received legal papers despite promises by the Greek government. In 1996, the two countries signed a Treaty of Peace and Friendship and discussed the issues of the status of Albanian refugees in Greece and education in the [[First language|mother tongue]] for the ethnic Greek minority in southern Albania. In the 1990s, Greece preferred and assisted [[Fatos Nano]] as Albanian leader due to him being Orthodox over [[Sali Berisha]] a Muslim, as Nano was seen as being friendlier to Greek interests.<ref name=\"Konidaris80\">{{cite book|last=Konidaris|first=Gerasimos|chapter=Examining policy responses to immigration in the light of relations and foreign policy objectives: Greece and Albania|editor1-last=King|editor1-first=Russell|editor2-last=Schwandner-Sievers|editor2-first=Stephanie |title=The new Albanian migration|year=2005|location=Brighton|publisher=Sussex Academic|isbn=9781903900789|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05Mw4-b9oN0C}} pp. 80–81. \"Greece's favorite candidate in these elections was clearly MR. Nano. As emerges from the interview material, he –unlike Berisha- was held in high esteem by the Greek side.

Greece's favour towards Nano was clearly demonstrated in June, when he was allowed to speak to a crowd of Albanian citizens at a pre-election rally in one of Athens' central squares. The police did not interfere and no arrests of illegal immigrants were made.\"</ref> The government of Fatos Nano was viewed by Turkey as having a pro-Greek orientation and expressed some dissatisfaction though during that time still maintained close military relations with Albania in rebuilding its armed forces and a military base.<ref name=\"LaniSchmidt90\">{{cite journal|last1=Lani|first1=Remzi|last2=Schmidt|first2=Fabian|title=Albanian foreign policy between geography and history|journal=The International Spectator|volume=33|issue=2|pages=79|year=1998|doi=10.1080/03932729808456809}} p. 90. \"In a broader Balkan context, Turkey has always seen the Albanians as its natural allies in the Balkans. If the Greeks and Serbs have stood on one side of the scale, the Turks and the Albanians have stood on the other. Although some kind of dissatisfaction with Nano's government is felt in Ankara over what is seen in the Turkish capital as Tirana's pro-Greek orientation, Turkey continues to have close military ties with Tirana; indeed, it is playing an important role in the re-organization of the disintegrated Albanian army. Albania's most important military base, which was destroyed during the armed uprising last year, will be rebuilt by Turkey.\"</ref>\n\nToday, as result of very frequent high-level contacts between the governments and the parliaments, relations between the two countries are regarded as excellent. Greece is a staunch supporter of the Euro-Atlantic integration of the Republic of Albania.

Big projects currently in running between the two countries include the touristic development of the Ionian coastline shared between the two countries, and the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), which helped boosting the relations of the two countries even further.\n\nAlbania's ties with Greece are also based on cultural and historic relations of the two peoples, including migration and national minorities. In addition, since Albania's transition to democracy, Greece has become a major financial partner of the country with Albania's economy being heavily reliant on investments from Greece. Culturally, the two nations' populations, whilst having a tense history, share numerous cultural and historic traits that have been used to boost the political relations of the neighbouring countries.\n\nThere had been numerous discussions, research and attempts by Albanians and Greeks to form a confederation during the Ottoman period.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/3475296|title=Historical Greek-Albanian Relations: Some Mysteries and Riddles|first=Helen|last=Abadzi|date=Winter 2011|access-date=27 June 2017|journal=Mediterranean Quarterly| volume=22|issue=1|pages=41–60|doi=10.1215/10474552-1189647|s2cid=153541212}}</ref> In the 19th century there were plans to create a Greek-Albanian confederation, which was revived from the earlier 18th century plans.
