The nation works closely with neighboring and regional countries, specifically in [[Asia-Pacific]], and consistently supports international initiatives to maintain peace, security and order. It is part of the non-aligned movement and adopts a balanced position regarding major power contestation.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.psd.gov.sg/heartofpublicservice/our-institutions/establishing-our-place-in-the-world/ | title=Establishing Our Place in the World | access-date=4 June 2022 | archive-date=31 August 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220831021641/https://www.psd.gov.sg/heartofpublicservice/our-institutions/establishing-our-place-in-the-world/ | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.mfa.gov.sg/overseas-mission/dubai/about-singapore/foreign-policy | title=Foreign Policy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/singapore-small-asian-heavyweight | title=Singapore: A Small Asian Heavyweight }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/five-core-principles-of-singapores-foreign-policy | title=Full speech: Five core principles of Singapore's foreign policy &#124; the Straits Times | date=17 July 2017 }}</ref> Due to its status, Singapore is the headquarters of the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) Secretariat, the [[Pacific Economic Cooperation Council]] (PECC) Secretariat, and is the host city of many [[MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions) tourism|international conferences and events]].

''Singapore's foreign policy: Coping with vulnerability'' (Psychology Press, 2000) </ref>\n\n* Formative Years (1965-1970s): In the early years after independence, Singapore faced numerous challenges, including the need to establish its sovereignty and secure its survival. Its foreign policy focused on seeking recognition and building diplomatic relations with other countries. Singapore pursued a policy of non-alignment and sought to establish itself as a reliable partner in the international community.\n\n* Economic Development and Trade (1970s-1980s): In the 1970s, Singapore began to prioritize economic development and trade as key pillars of its foreign policy. The government implemented pro-business policies, attracted foreign investments, and actively pursued trade agreements with various countries. Singapore also joined regional organizations like ASEAN in 1967 to enhance economic cooperation and promote stability in Southeast Asia.\n\n* Regional Security and ASEAN (1980s-1990s): As Singapore grew economically, it became increasingly concerned about regional security. It played an active role in promoting regional stability through initiatives like the Five Power Defense Arrangements (FPDA) and the Zone of Peace, Freedom, and Neutrality (ZOPFAN). Singapore supported the establishment of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in 1994, which aimed to enhance security cooperation and dialogue among ASEAN and its partners.\n\n* Pragmatic Diplomacy and Bilateral Relations (1990s-2000s): Singapore's foreign policy during this period emphasized pragmatic diplomacy and building strong bilateral relations with major powers. It sought to diversify its partnerships and engaged with countries like the United States, China, and India to enhance economic ties, attract investments, and promote regional stability. Singapore also hosted several high-profile international events and conferences to bolster its diplomatic profile.\n\n* Economic Integration and Free Trade (2000s-Present): In the 2000s, Singapore continued to prioritize economic integration and free trade. It actively pursued bilateral and regional free trade agreements (FTAs) to expand market access and boost economic growth. Notable agreements include the Singapore-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (2003), the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement with India (2005), and participation in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).\n\n* Global Engagement and Multilateralism: Singapore has increasingly engaged in global affairs and actively participated in multilateral institutions. It has sought to shape global norms and contribute to issues such as climate change, sustainable development, and cybersecurity. Singapore has played an active role in organizations like the United Nations (UN), World Trade Organization (WTO), and ASEAN to advance its interests and contribute to international cooperation.\n\n==Foreign policy approaches==\n\nSingapore's leaders are [[realism (international relations)|realists]]; they perceive a [[Hobbes]]ian world where might makes right.<ref name=desker>{{cite book | author = B.

Rajaratnam]], and the country's foreign policy still bears his imprimatur. Rajaratnam originally framed Singapore's foreign policy, taking into account \"the jungle of international politics\", and was wary of foreign policy \"on the basis of permanent enemies.\"<ref name=desker/> In 1966, S. Rajaratnam saw Singapore's challenge as ensuring its sustained survival, peace, and prosperity in a region suffering from mutual jealousies, internal violence, economic disintegration and great power conflicts.<ref name=desker/>\n\nIn accordance with this worldview, Singapore's foreign policy is aimed at maintaining friendly relations with all countries, especially Malaysia, Indonesia, and ASEAN, and ensuring that its actions do not exacerbate its neighbours' insecurities.<ref name=desker/> In 1972, Rajaratnam envisioned the world being Singapore's hinterland – integration into the world economy would ameliorate Singapore's inherent lack of natural resources. Thus, Rajaratnam believed that maintaining a [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]], rather than becoming a de facto vassal of some larger power, would provide Singapore with freedom to pursue an independent foreign policy. The cultivation of the great powers' interest in Singapore also would effectively function to deter the interference of regional powers.<ref name=desker/><ref>Michael Leifer, ''Singapore's foreign policy: Coping with vulnerability'' (Psychology Press, 2000).</ref>\n\n==Trade agreements==\n\n{{main|Economy of Singapore#International trade agreements}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Economy||Agreement||Abbreviation||Concluded||Signed||Effective||Legal text\n|-\n|New Zealand||[[Agreement between New Zealand and Singapore on a Closer Economic Partnership]]||ANZSCEP||18 August 2000||14 November 2000||1 January 2001||[https://web.archive.org/web/20051030182753/http://www.fta.gov.sg/fta/pdf/anzscep.pdf]\n|-\n|[[European Free Trade Association]]||[[Agreement between the EFTA States and Singapore]]||EFTA-Singapore FTA||11 April 2002||26 June 2002||1 January 2003||[https://web.archive.org/web/20051030182741/http://www.fta.gov.sg/fta/pdf/FTA_ESFTA_Agreement.pdf]\n|-\n|Japan||[[Agreement between Japan and the Republic of Singapore for a New-Age Economic Partnership]]||JSEPA||October 2001||13 January 2002|||| [https://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/singapore/jsepa-1.pdf]\n|-\n|United States||[[United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement]]||USSFTA||19 November 2002||6 May 2003||1 January 2004||[https://web.archive.org/web/20051103052050/http://www.fta.gov.sg/fta/pdf/FTA_USSFTA_Agreement_Final.pdf]\n|-\n|[[Jordan]]||[[Singapore Jordan Free Trade Agreement]]||SJFTA||29 April 2004||16 May 2004||&nbsp;||[https://web.archive.org/web/20051030182733/http://www.fta.gov.sg/fta/pdf/FTA_SJFTA_Final%20FTA%20text%2015%20May%202004.pdf]\n|-\n|[[Brunei]]||rowspan=3|[[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement]]||rowspan=3|Trans-Pacific SEP||rowspan=3|&nbsp;||August 2005||rowspan=3|1 January 2006||rowspan=3|[https://web.archive.org/web/20051103052050/http://www.fta.gov.sg/fta/pdf/FTA_USSFTA_Agreement_Final.pdf]\n|-\n|[[Chile]]||18 July 2005\n|-\n|New Zealand||18 July 2005\n|-\n|India||[[India–Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement|India - Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement]]||India-Singapore CECA||November 2004||29 June 2005||1 August 2005||[https://web.archive.org/web/20051030182713/http://app.fta.gov.sg/data//fta/file/India-Singapore%20Comprehensive%20Economic%20Cooperation%20Agreement.pdf]\n|-\n|[[South Korea|Korea]]||[[Korea-Singapore Free Trade Agreement]]||KSFTA||28 November 2004||4 August 2005||End 2005||[https://web.archive.org/web/20051030182704/https://app.fta.gov.sg/data/fta/file/KSFTA_final_KSFTA.pdf]\n|-\n|[[Peru]]||[[Peru-Singapore Free Trade Agreement]]||PesFTA||September 2007||29 May 2008||Early 2009||\n|}\n\n==International organizations==\n\n===APEC===\n\nThe [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) is based in Singapore, of which Singapore is a founding member of.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apec.org/About-Us/About-APEC/History|title=History|website=www.apec.org|access-date=23 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124005732/https://www.apec.org/About-Us/About-APEC/History|archive-date=24 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Singapore has long recognised the importance of APEC as an essential platform for promoting economic linkages and its benefits towards strengthening regional peace and security between member economies.

Taiwan has a [[Taipei Representative Office in Singapore|representative office]] in Singapore.

The two nations have enjoyed an extensive relationship in many facets such as trade and defence, most noticeably being Singapore's establishment of military bases in Taiwan for its troops to conduct overseas training.\n\nLike Thailand where Singapore today adopted modern military training bases with, Taiwan was also under Japanese [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] influence leading up to post-World War II. Strategically, the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]] and the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya]] was made possible and expedited because of Thai and Taiwanese varied involvements and / or assistances towards the Japanese war efforts. Since the independence of Singapore and the establishment of [[Kuomintang]] rule over the island of Taiwan, the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) adopted military training bases in Taiwan from 1975 that included combined arms exercises involving infantry, artillery, and armored units. The then prime minister of Singapore [[Lee Kuan Yew]] also appointed Taiwanese military personnel in training [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]]{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}.
