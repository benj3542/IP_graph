"{{Short description|none}} <!-- \"none\" is preferred when the title is sufficiently descriptive; see [[WP:SDNONE]] -->\n{{Politics of Spain}}\nThe '''foreign relations of Spain''' could be constructed upon the foreign relations of the [[Spanish Empire|Hispanic Crown]]. The personal union of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] that ensued with the joint rule of the [[Catholic Monarchs]] was followed by the annexation of the [[Kingdom of Granada]] and the [[Kingdom of Navarre]]. The crown also built a [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|large colonial empire in the Americas]] after the arrival of Columbus to the New World in 1492.\n\nThe Spanish Habsburg monarchs had large holdings across the European continent stemming from the inherited dominions of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] and from the Aragonese holdings in the Italian Peninsula. The Habsburg dynasty fought against the Protestant [[Reformation]] in the continent and achieved a dynastic unification of the realms of the Iberian Peninsula with their enthronement as Portuguese monarchs after 1580. The American colonies shipped bullion, but resources were spent in wars waged against France in Italy and elsewhere as well as in conflicts against the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] or revolts in the Spanish Netherlands, Portugal (lost after 1640) and [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]] (lost in 1640 and recovered after 1652). Mainland Spain was the main theatre of the [[War of Spanish Succession]] (1701–1714), after which the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon dynasty]] consolidated rule, while handing in holdings in Italy and the Netherlands. The successive Bourbon [[Pacte de Famille|Family Compacts]] underpinned a close alignment with the Kingdom of France throughout the 18th century. During the Napoleonic Wars, Mainland Spain was occupied by the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (which installed a puppet ruler), and became after an 1808 uprising the main theatre of the [[Peninsular War]]. Nearly all its colonies fought for and won independence in the early 19th century. From then on it kept Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines, otherwise lost in 1898 after the [[Spanish–American War]], and, in line with [[Scramble for Africa|far-reaching efforts by other European powers]], Spain began to sustain a colonial presence in the African continent, most notably in Western Sahara and Equatorial Guinea. It also [[Cochinchina campaign|intervened in Nguyễn Vietnam alongside France]] and involved in the affairs of former colony Santo Domingo, which briefly returned to Spanish control. In the wake of the creation of a Spanish protectorate in Northern Morocco, the early 20th century saw a [[Rif War|draining conflict against Riffian anti-colonial resistance]]. Spain stuck to a status of neutrality during [[World War I]].\n\nThe [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936–1939 became a proxy war between the axis powers [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Italy]] and the [[Soviet Union]] (which lost). The war ensued with the installment of a [[Francoist Spain|dictatorship under Francisco Franco]] lasting until 1975. In the aftermath of World War 2, the series of multilateral agreements and institutions configuring what it is known today as [[Western Europe]] were made apart from Francoist Spain.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.cepc.gob.es/sites/default/files/2021-12/35203rei07001007.pdf|author-link=Ángel Viñas|last=Viñas|title=Soberanía nacional y pactos militares: El caso de España|first=Ángel|journal=Revista de Estudios Internacionales|year=1986|page=10}}</ref> The [[Pact of Madrid|1953 military agreements with the United States]] entailed the acceptance of unprecedented conditions vis-à-vis the (peacetime) military installment of a foreign power on Spanish soil.{{Sfn|Viñas|1986|p=12}} Spain joined the UN in 1955 and the IMF in 1958.{{Sfn|Viñas|1986|pp=10–11}} In the last rales of the dictator, the mismanaged decolonisation of [[Spanish Sahara]] ensued with the [[Green March|Moroccan invasion of the territory]] in 1975 and the [[Madrid Accords|purported partition of it between Morocco and Mauritania]], spawning a protracted conflict pitting the Sahrawi national liberation [[Polisario Front]] against Morocco and (briefly) Mauritania lasting to this day. Spain joined [[NATO]] (1982) and [[Accession Treaty of Spain to the European Economic Community|entered the European Communities]] (1986).\n\nOn a wide range of issues, Spain often prefers to coordinate its efforts with its EU partners through the European political cooperation mechanisms.

The Romans introduced the [[Latin language]], the ancestor of both modern-day [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. The Iberian peninsula remained under Roman rule for over 600 years, until the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|collapse of the Western Roman Empire]].\n\nIn the [[History of early modern Italy|Early modern period]], until the 18th century, [[southern Italy|southern]] and [[insular Italy]] came under Spanish control, having been previously a domain of the [[Crown of Aragon]].\n[[File:Dominions House Habsburg abdication Charles V.jpg|thumb|275px|Dominions of the Habsburgs in 1556]]\n\n===Charles V===\n{{Main|Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor}}\nCharles V (1500–1558) inherited vast lands across Western Europe and the Americas, and expanded them by frequent wars.<ref>Geoffrey Parker, ''Emperor: A New Life of Charles V'' (2019) [https://www.amazon.com/Emperor-New-Life-Charles-V/dp/0300196520/  excerpt]</ref> Among other domains he was King of Spain from 1516, and Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria from 1519.

His great enemy on land was France, on the Mediterranean Sea it was the Ottoman Empire, which at times was allied with France.  England and the Papacy were sometimes part of the coalition against him. Much of his attention focused on wars in Italy. At the [[Diet of Augsburg]] (1547) he secured recognition that the Netherlands belonged to the Hapsburg domain. However Charles was intensely Catholic and the northern Netherlands  was Protestant. He and his Spanish heirs fought for a century against Dutch independence; despite the enormous cost they failed.<ref>Karl Brandi, ''The Emperor Charles V: the growth and destiny of a man and of a world-empire'' (1971) [https://archive.org/details/emperorcharlesvg0000bran  online]</ref>\n\n===Philip II, 1556–1598===\n{{Main|Philip II of Spain#Foreign policy}}\n\n===Philip III, 1598–1621===\n{{Main|Philip III of Spain#Foreign policy}}\n\n[[File:The Somerset House Conference 19 August 1604.jpg|thumb|The [[Somerset House]] Conference between English and Spanish diplomats that brought an end to the [[Anglo–Spanish War (1585)|Anglo–Spanish War]] (1585–1604).]]\n\nPhilip III has a poor reputation in terms of both domestic and foreign policy. He inherited two major conflicts from his father. The first of these, the long-running [[Eighty Years' War|Dutch revolt]], represented a serious challenge to Spanish power from the Protestant [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] in a crucial part of the [[Spanish Empire]]. The second, the [[Anglo–Spanish War (1585)|Anglo–Spanish War]] was a newer, and less critical conflict with Protestant England, marked by a Spanish failure to successfully bring its huge military resources to bear on the smaller English military.<ref>Patrick Williams, ''The Great Favourite: the Duke of Lerma and the court and government of Philip III of Spain, 1598–1621'' (Manchester UP, 2006).</ref>\n\nPhilip's own foreign policy can be divided into three phases.

At first most of the warfare took place outside of Spain. However, in 1704 Spain was invaded by the Germans (officially by the [[Holy Roman Empire]] including [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], as well as other minor German states), Great Britain, the [[Dutch Republic]], the [[Duchy of Savoy]] and Portugal. The invaders wanted to make the Habsburg candidate king instead of the incumbent [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] who the grandson of France's powerful king [[Louis XIV]] and candidate of the [[House of Bourbon]]. Spain had no real army, but it defense was a high priority for Louis XIV who sent in his French armies and after a devastating civil war eventually drove out the invaders from Spain.<ref>John Lynch, ''Bourbon Spain 1700–1808'' (1989) pp 22–77.</ref><ref>J.S.

In practice his wife [[Elisabeth Farnese]] ruled Spain from 1714 until 1746, and was more interested in Italy than Spain. Spain was not even invited to the peace treaties ([[Peace of Utrecht]]); they forbade any future possibility of unifying the French and Spanish crowns. Britain was the main winner; it blocked France from becoming too powerful. Britain acquired Minorca and Gibraltar from Spain, as well as the right to sell slaves to Spanish colonies. Britain also gained Newfoundland and Nova Scotia from France. Spain kept its American colonies but lost its European holdings in Italy and the Spanish Netherlands (modern Belgium), mostly to Austria. Spain briefly regained some Italian holdings until the British sank its fleet in 1718. Elisabeth Farnese succeeded in recapturing Naples and Sicily. She put her son on the throne there. He abdicated in 1759 to return to Madrid as King [[Charles III of Spain]].<ref>Lynch, ''Bourbon Spain 1700–1808'' (1989) pp 110–113, 125, 131–133, 193–195, 247.</ref><ref>Henry Kamen, ''Empire: How Spain Became a World Power, 1492–1763'' (2004) pp. 442–454.</ref>\n\n===American Revolutionary War: 1775–1783===\n{{Main|Spain and the American Revolutionary War}}\nEager to gain revenge on the British for its defeat during the Seven Years' War, France offered support to rebel American colonists seeking independence from Britain during the [[American War of Independence]] and in 1778 entered the war on their side. They then urged Spain to do the same, hoping the combined force would be strong enough to overcome the British [[Royal Navy]] and be able to invade England. In 1779 Spain joined the war, hoping to take advantage of a substantially weakened Britain.

During [[José María Aznar]]'s government, Spanish relations worsened with countries like Mexico, Venezuela and Cuba, but were exceptionally good with others, like Colombia, the Dominican Republic and several [[Central America]]n republics. [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]]'s victory in the 2004 general elections changed this setting. Despite long-standing close linguistic, economic and cultural relations with most of Latin America, some aspects of Spanish foreign policy during this time, such as its support for the Iraq War, were not supported or widely favored.\n\n=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===\nSpain has gradually begun to broaden its contacts with [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].

Spain maintains sovereignty over Ceuta, Melilla, Peñon de Velez de la Gomera, Alhucemas and the Chafarinas Islands (captured following the Christian reconquest of Spain) based upon historical grounds, security reasons and on the basis of the UN principle of [[territorial integrity]].

The population is 80% ethnic Portuguese and 30% of Portuguese language. Olivenza/Olivença was under continuous Portuguese sovereignty since 1297 until it was [[War of the Oranges|occupied by the Spanish in 1801]] and formally ceded by Portugal later that year by the [[Treaty of Badajoz (1801)|Treaty of Badajoz]]. Spain claims the ''de jure'' (legal) sovereignty over Olivenza/Olivença on the grounds that the Treaty of Badajoz still stands and has never been revoked. Thus, the border between the two countries in the region of Olivenza/Olivença should be as demarcated by that treaty. Portugal claims the ''de jure'' sovereignty over Olivenza/Olivença on the grounds that the Treaty of Badajoz was revoked by its own terms (the breach of any of its articles would lead to its cancellation) when Spain invaded Portugal in the [[Peninsular War]] of 1807.<ref>Miguel A.

Identity midway between dialogue and settlement of accounts.\" in ''European Border Regions in Comparison'' (Routledge, 2014). 31–50.</ref>\n\nPortugal further bases its case on Article 105 of the [[Congress of Vienna|Treaty of Vienna]] of 1815, which Spain signed in 1817, that states that the winning countries are to \"endeavour with the mightiest conciliatory effort to return Olivenza/Olivença to Portuguese authority\". Thus, the border between the two countries in the region of Olivenza/Olivença should be as demarcated by the Treaty of Alcanizes of 1297. Spain interprets Article 105 as not being mandatory on demanding Spain to return Olivenza/Olivença to Portugal, thus not revoking the Treaty of Badajoz. Portugal has never made a formal claim to the territory after the Treaty of Vienna, but has equally never directly acknowledged the Spanish sovereignty over Olivenza/Olivença.  Portugal continues to claim Olivenza/Olivença, asserting that under the [[Treaty of Vienna (1815)|Vienna Treaty]] of 1815, Spain recognized the Portuguese claims as \"legitimate\".\n\nAnother dispute surrounds the [[Savage Islands]], which Spain acknowledges to be part of [[Portugal]]. However, Spain claims that they are rocks rather than islands, and therefore Spain does not accept the Portuguese [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (200 nautical miles) generated by the islands, while acknowledging the ''Selvagens'' as possessing [[territorial waters]] (12 nautical miles). On 5 July 2013, Spain sent a letter to the UN expressing these views.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/prt44_09/esp_re_prt2013.pdf|title=Spain's letter to the UN|publisher=UN|date=September 2013|language=es|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525185334/http://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/prt44_09/esp_re_prt2013.pdf|archive-date=25 May 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/spain-disputes-portugal-islands/29269 \"Spain disputes Portugal islands\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908225016/http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/spain-disputes-portugal-islands/29269|date=8 September 2013 }} ''[[The Portugal News]]''.

The move has the potential to hurt some Spanish companies however relations were said to be \"positive\" between the Bolivian state and Spanish private sector energy companies. Evo Morales said that Bolivia is ready to accept outside investment in its energy and natural resource industries as long as foreign firms do not act as owners and that Bolivia is \"looking for investment, be it from private or state sector. We want partners, not owners of our natural resources.\"\n\nIt was suggested that Bolivia would also negotiate with Spanish companies to produce car parts and lithium batteries in the

valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Portugal}}||{{dts|5 October 1143}}<ref name=\":19\" />||See [[Portugal–Spain relations]]\nPortugal's copy of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] (1494) divided the New World between Portugal and Castile. During the 15th century, Portugal built increasingly large fleets of ships and began to explore the world beyond Europe, sending explorers to Africa and Asia. Castile followed suit decades later. Following the first Spanish voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]] to the Caribbean in 1492, both states began acquiring territory in the New World. As a result of the 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], Portugal acquired its most potentially important colony, [[colony of Brazil|Brazil]] (much of the [[South America]]n continent), as well as a number of possessions in Africa and Asia, while Castile took the rest of South America and much of the North American continent as well as a number of possessions in Africa, Oceanía and Asia as the important colony of the [[Philippines]]. This line of demarcation was about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands (already Portuguese) and the islands claimed for Castile by Columbus on his first voyage. Although the Treaty of Tordesillas attempted to clarify their empires, many subsequent treaties were needed to establish the modern boundaries of Brazil and the 1529 [[Treaty of Zaragoza]] was needed to demarcate their Asian possessions.\n\n[[Henry, King of Portugal|Henry of Portugal]], reigned until his death (31 January 1580). He lacked heirs and his death triggered a [[1580 Portuguese succession crisis|succession crisis]], where the main claimants to the throne were [[Philip II of Spain]] and [[Anthony, Prior of Crato]]. After the Spanish victory in the [[War of Portuguese Succession]] Philip of Spain was crowned king of Portugal in 1581, beginning a personal union between the two nations known as the [[Iberian Union]] generating a decline of the Portuguese Empire during the period of Union. The Iberian Union lasted for almost sixty years until 1640, when the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] was initiated against Spain and Portugal reestablished the Portuguese dynasty under the [[House of Bragança|Bragança]].\n\nRelations between Portugal and Spain are also good. They cooperate in the fight against drug trafficking and tackling forest fires (common in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in summers), for example.
