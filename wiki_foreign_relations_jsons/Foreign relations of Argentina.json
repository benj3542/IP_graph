The urgency for a complete [[Laissez-faire|liberalization of commerce]] remained a powerful political cause for [[Criollo people|Criollos]] and [[Mestizo]]s, further stimulated by the politically egalitarian and revolutionary ideals spread by the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution|Anglo-American]] revolutions. Ultimately, the actual experience of successfully defending without Spanish aid the viceroyalty from a foreign invader during the 1806–1807 [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata]], triggered a decisive quest for even greater autonomy from the colonial metropolis.\n\nBetween 1808 and 1810, the [[First French Empire|Napoleonic French Empire]] openly [[Peninsular War|invaded Spain]], after deposing King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] and taking him prisoner. A Spanish resistance formed an emergency government, the [[Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom (Spain)|Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom]] in order to govern themselves and the Spanish Empire in the absence of Ferdinand VII. But, when the Supreme Central Junta dissolved itself on 29 January 1810, under extreme pressure from Napoleonic forces, most of the [[Spanish American wars of independence|main cities of Spanish America]] refused to acknowledge its successor, a Regency Council, as the legitimate depositary of sovereignty. They proceed to name their own local [[junta (Peninsular War)|junta]]s, as a means to exercise government in the absence of the prisoner king.\n\nOn [[May Revolution|25 May 1810]], a Criollo-led ''[[Open cabildo|cabildo abierto]]'' formally assumed the authority from Viceroy [[Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros]]. However, the ensuing [[United Provinces of South America]] (formed on the basis of the former Viceroyalty) declared itself independent on 9 July 1816, after [[Ferdinand VII]] was restored in 1815. During the [[Argentine War of Independence|Independence Wars]] no sovereign state recognized the United Provinces.\n\nUntil the fall of the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Royalist]] stronghold of [[Lima]] in 1821, and the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] of 1824, territorial integrity was solely sustained by the military brilliance of Generals [[José de San Martín]] and [[Manuel Belgrano]], the continuous efforts of northern provinces defenders [[Martín Miguel de Güemes]] and [[Juana Azurduy]], among many others. However, during this same period, internecine power conflicts among diverse leaders, and ideological and economical struggles developed between [[Buenos Aires Province]] and much of the rest of the United Provinces, with many of the Provinces bonding themselves into a [[Liga Federal|Federal League]], inspired by ''Federalist'' [[José Gervasio Artigas]]' leadership. In practice, each side treated the other's grievances as a \"foreign policy\" matter.\n\nThe ''[[centralized government|Unitarian]]'' Constitution of 1819 was immediately rejected by the provinces, and a state of anarchy ensued following the [[Battle of Cepeda (1820)|Battle of Cepeda]]. The only cause that could regain unity among the hostile factions was the 1825 invasion of what today is [[Uruguay]] on the part of [[Brazilian Empire]]. Uruguay, then known as the ''Province of the Eastern Bank of the Uruguay River'', was considered a somewhat breakaway Province, since [[Montevideo]] served as the seat of the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Royalist]] Viceroy [[Francisco Javier de Elío]] during its war on the [[May Revolution]]; and that, after the independentists victory, the Province became the main stronghold of the [[Liga Federal|Federal League]] leader [[José Gervasio Artigas]], who waged a long and bitter dispute during the 1810s against the [[Unitarian Party|Unitarians]] about the shape the national organization would have.\n\nThe war crisis led to a new Constitution and a first semblance of a united national government, at the same time it represented the first foreign policy crisis of the young nation (known as ''República Argentina'', ''per'' the 1926 Constitution), as it forced the nation into war with Brazil.\n\nThe common cause the crisis provided did lead to enough institutional stability to have the [[British Empire]] recognize Argentina (as President [[James Monroe]] had the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] done in 1822) and led to the election of the first [[List of heads of state of Argentina|President of Argentina]]. The opportunity for unity, however, was wasted largely because the new President, [[Bernardino Rivadavia]], pushed a new Constitution even more biased towards Buenos Aires' agenda than the failed 1819 document. The war with Brazil, moreover, went badly. Land battles were won, early on, and despite some heroic feats on the part on Irish-born Admiral [[Guillermo Brown]], the war dragged on, resulting in bankruptcy. This and the hated new constitution led to the end of the first republic by 1828; it also led, however, to peace with Brazil and the formation of an independent [[Uruguay]].\n\n26 September 1828 treaty itself became another foreign policy crisis, as it triggered a violent ''coup d'état'' by generals opposed to what they saw as a unilateral surrender. The murder of the man responsible for the treaty, Buenos Aires Governor [[Manuel Dorrego]], itself led to a countercoup that brought with it the promise of a lasting peace; but eventually led to destabilizing consequences.\n\nThe countercoup brought in a new governor for the [[Buenos Aires Province]], who would in time become the leading figure of a loose [[confederation]] of Argentine Provinces (the so-called [[Argentine Confederation]]). [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] made it his mission to stabilize Argentina in a confederacy under the tutelage of Buenos Aires Province. This led to repression, massacres of Native Americans in the [[Pampas]] and, in 1838, an international embargo over the case of a French journalist tortured to death at Rosas' orders.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} An unyielding Rosas might have let the impasse continue for a decade or more; but, Admiral [[Guillermo Brown]] made his talents amenable once again, forcing the French blockade to be lifted in 1841.\n\nHaving come to power avenging the murder of a man who had decided to cease interference in Uruguay, Rosas invaded Uruguay upon the 1842 election of a government there antagonistic to his personal commercial interests (mainly centered in the export of cow hides and beef jerky, valuable commodities in those days). Commercially close with the French and British Empires, Uruguay's crisis met with swift reprisals against Rosas and the Argentine Confederacy from the two mighty powers. Slapped with fresh embargoes and a joint blockade, Argentina by 1851 found itself bankrupt and with \"rogue nation\" standing; on 3 February 1852, a surprise military campaign led by the Governor of [[Entre Ríos Province]], [[Justo José de Urquiza]], put an end to the Rosas regime and, until 1878, at least, serious Argentine foreign policy misadventures.\n\n=== Constitution and conflict resolution ===\n[[File:Abrazo del Estrecho (1899).jpg|thumb|left|President Julio Roca hosts Argentine and Chilean negotiators in an 1899 bid to avoid war.]]\nThe deposition of Rosas led to Argentina's present institutional framework, outlined in the [[Argentine Constitution|1853 constitution]]. The document, drafted by a legal scholar specializing in the interpretation of the [[United States Constitution]] put forth national social and economic development as its overriding principle. Where foreign policy was concerned, it specifically put emphasis on the need to encourage immigration and little else, save for the national defense against aggressions. This, of course, was forced into practice by Paraguayan dictator [[Francisco Solano López (politician)|Francisco Solano López]]'s disastrous 1865 invasion of northern Argentine territory, leading to an [[Paraguayan War|alliance]] between 1820s-era adversaries Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay and the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives (particularly Paraguay's own).\n\nSetbacks notwithstanding, the policy was successful. Domestically, Argentina was quickly transformed by immigration and foreign investment into, arguably, the most educationally and economically advanced nation in Latin America. Whatever else was happening domestically, internationally, Argentine policy earned a reputation for pragmatism and the reliance of conflict resolution as a vehicle to advance national interests. The era's new strongman, Gen. [[Julio Roca]], was the first Argentine leader to treat foreign policy on equal footing with foreign investment and immigration incentives, universal education and repression as instruments of national development. His first administration occupied [[Patagonia]] and entered into an 1881 agreement with Chile to that effect and his second one commissioned archaeologist [[Francisco Moreno]] to survey an appropriate boundary between the two neighbors, which brought Chile into the historic [[Pactos de Mayo|1902 pact]], settling questions over Patagonian lands east of the [[Andes]]. Later that year, endorsed his Foreign Secretary's successful negotiation of a debt dispute between [[Venezuela]], France and Germany. Foreign Secretary [[Luis Drago]]'s proposal in this, a dispute among third parties, became the [[Drago Doctrine]], part of [[international law]] to this day.\n\n[[File:Paz del Chaco.jpg|thumb|Signatories of the 1938 treaty ending the Chaco War gather in Buenos Aires. Foreign Minister Carlos Saavedra Lamas is at right]]\nThis success led to a joint effort between Argentina, Brazil and [[Chile]] to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the United States' [[Veracruz Incident|occupation of Veracruz, Mexico]] in April 1914. That May, the three nations' foreign ministers hosted U.S. officials in Canada, a conference instrumental in the withdrawal of U.S. troops that November. This also resulted in the 1915 [[ABC pact]] signed between the three and, like Brazil and Chile, Argentina thereafter pursued a pragmatic foreign policy, focused on preserving favorable trade relationships. This policy was in evidence during the 1933 [[Roca-Runciman Treaty]], which secured Argentine markets among British colonies, and in the Argentine position during the [[Chaco War]]. Resulting from the 1928 discovery of petroleum in the area, the dispute developed into war after [[Bolivia]]'s appeal for Argentine intervention in what it saw as Paraguayan incursions into potentially oil-rich lands were rejected. Bolivia invaded in July 1932 and, despite its legitimate claim to what historically had been its territory, its government's ties to [[Standard Oil of New Jersey]] (with whom the Argentine government was in dispute over its alleged pirating of oil in [[Salta Province]])<ref name=Wirth>Wirth, John. ''The Oil Business in Latin America''. Beard Books, 2001.</ref> led Buenos Aires to withhold diplomatic efforts until, in June 1935, a cease-fire was signed. The laborious negotiations called in Buenos Aires by Argentine Foreign Minister [[Carlos Saavedra Lamas]] yielded him Latin America's first [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1936 and a formal peace treaty in July 1938.\n\n==World War II==\n{{main|Argentina during World War II|Inter-American Conference on Problems of War and Peace}}\nAs they had during World War I, Argentine governments of different ideological stripes remained consistent in one important foreign policy point: they maintained Argentina neutral, preferring to offer the nation's vast [[Agriculture in Argentina|agricultural export]] capacity to British and U.S. wartime needs; indeed, Argentine trade surpluses totalled US$1&nbsp;billion during World War I and US$1.7&nbsp;billion during World War II.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indec.mecon.ar/nuevaweb/cuadros/19/anuario_com_ext_06.pdf |title=INDEC |access-date=2 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031130057/http://www.indec.mecon.ar/nuevaweb/cuadros/19/anuario_com_ext_06.pdf |archive-date=31 October 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn early 1945, the United States and 19 Latin American countries met in Mexico at the [[Inter-American Conference on Problems of War and Peace]].

Kennedy in United States, 1961.]]\n\nThe incipient [[Cold War]] in evidence following World War II led the new administration of [[Juan Perón]] to conclude that a third world war might follow. Perón restored diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and, in 1949, articulated a \"third way\" as his foreign policy doctrine, in hopes of avoiding friction with either superpower, while opening the door to grain sales to the perennially shortage-stricken Soviets. Though commercial concerns continued to dominate foreign policy, conflict resolution was again ventured into when President [[Arturo Frondizi]] initiated negotiations between U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] and Cuban representative [[Che Guevara|Ernesto ''Che'' Guevara]] during a Western Hemisphere summit in [[Uruguay]] in August 1961. Frondizi followed these exchanges with private discussions with ''Che'' Guevara in Buenos Aires, a misstep resulting in the Argentine military's opposition to further talks. Ultimately, Cuba was expelled from the [[Organization of American States]] in January 1962 and Frondizi was forced by the military to resign that March. The effort, though fruitless, showed audacity on the part of Frondizi, whom President Kennedy called \"a really tough man.\"<ref>''Clarín''. 19 April 1995.</ref>\n\n=== A stray from precedent ===\n{{Main|Argentina–Chile relations|Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute}}\n\nArgentina's relations with its neighbor [[Chile]], though generally cordial, have been strained by territorial disputes – mostly along their mountainous shared border – since the nineteenth century.\n\nIn 1958 the [[Argentine Navy]] shelled a Chilean lighthouse during the [[Snipe incident]].\n\nOn 6 November 1965 the Argentine Gendarmerie killed Chilean Lieutenant [[Hernán Merino Correa]], member of [[Carabineros de Chile]] in the [[Laguna del Desierto incident]].\n\nIn 1978 the bellicose<ref>See Argentine Historian Luis Alberto Romero (''Argentina in the Twentieth Century'', Pennsylvania State University Press, translated by James P.

First, those who were dubious feared a possible regionalization of the conflict. Second, as a consequence, the conflict could acquire great power proportions.

In November 1998, Argentina hosted the United Nations conference on [[climate change]], and in October 1999 in Berlin, became one of the first nations worldwide to adopt a voluntary [[greenhouse gas]] [[emissions target]].\n\nArgentina also became a leading advocate of [[nuclear proliferation|non-proliferation]] efforts worldwide. After trying to develop nuclear weapons during the [[National Reorganization Process|1976 military dictatorship]], Argentina scrapped the project with the return of democratic rule in 1983, and became a strong advocate of non-proliferation efforts and the peaceful use of nuclear technologies.\n\nSince the return of democracy, Argentina has also turned into strong proponent of enhanced regional stability in South America, the country revitalized its relationship with Brazil; and during the 1990s (after signing the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina) settled lingering border disputes with [[Chile]]; discouraged military takeovers in Ecuador and [[Paraguay]]; served with the United States, Brazil and Chile as one of the four guarantors of the Ecuador–Peru peace process. Argentina's reputation as a mediator was damaged, however, when President Menem and some members of his cabinet were accused of approving the illegal sale of weapons to Ecuador and to [[Croatia]].\n\nIn 1998, President Menem made a state visit to the United Kingdom, and the Prince of Wales reciprocated with a visit to Argentina. In 1999, the two countries agreed to normalize travel to the [[Falkland Islands]] ({{langx|es|link=no|Islas Malvinas}}) from the mainland and resumed direct flights.\n\nIn the 1990s, Argentina was an enthusiastic supporter of the [[Summit of the Americas]] process, and chaired the [[Free Trade Agreement of the Americas]] (FTAA) initiative.\n\n=== Kirchner Presidency ===\n[[File:BRICS members and guest at the 6th BRICS summit 2014.jpg|thumb|240px|President [[Cristina Kirchner]] alongside the members of [[BRICS]] and [[Union of South American Nations]] in 2014.]]\nWithin the term of President [[Néstor Kirchner]], from 2003 onwards, Argentina suspended its policy of automatic alignment with the United States and moved closer to other Latin American countries. Argentina no longer supports the UN Commission on Human Rights resolution criticizing the \"human rights situation in Cuba\" and calling upon the Government of Cuba to \"adhere to international human rights norms\", but has chosen instead to abstain. In the [[2006 United Nations Security Council election]], Argentina supported, like all Mercosur countries, the candidacy of Venezuela (a Mercosur member) over Guatemala for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council.\n\nThe [[Mercosur]] has become a central part of the Argentine foreign policy, with the goal of forming a Latin American [[trade bloc]]. Argentina has chosen to form a bloc with Brazil when it comes to external negotiations, though the economic asymmetries between South America's two largest countries have produced tension at times.\n\nBetween 4 and 5 November 2005, the city of [[Mar del Plata]] hosted the [[Mar del Plata Summit of the Americas|Fourth Summit of the Americas]]. Although the themes were unemployment and poverty, most of the discussion was focused on the FTAA. The summit was a failure in this regard, but marked a clear split between the countries of the Mercosur, plus [[Venezuela]], and the supporters of the FTAA, led by the United States, Mexico and Canada. FTAA negotiations have effectively stalled until at least the conclusion of the 2006 [[Doha round]] global trade talks.\n\nIn 2005, Argentina assumed again (see history [[List of elected members of the United Nations Security Council#Scoretable|here]] ) the two-year non-permanent position on the [[UN Security Council]].\n\nAs of 2007, during Kirchner's almost four years in power, Argentina entered into 294 bilateral agreements, including 39 with [[Venezuela]], 37 with [[Chile]], 30 with [[Bolivia]], 21 with Brazil, 12 with China, 10 with Germany, 9 with the United States and Italy, and 7 with [[Cuba]], Paraguay, Spain and Russia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.eluniversal.com/2007/03/22/en_pol_art_kirchner-signed-39-p_22A847381.shtml |title=Daily News – eluniversal.com |access-date=22 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070330043725/http://english.eluniversal.com/2007/03/22/en_pol_art_kirchner-signed-39-p_22A847381.shtml |archive-date=30 March 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Macri Presidency ===\n[[File:Trump macri shaking hands argentina.jpg|alt=|thumb|285x285px|Argentine President [[Mauricio Macri]] with U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] in [[Buenos Aires]], during the [[2018 G20 Buenos Aires summit|2018 G20 Summit.]]]]\nMauricio Macri started his term with a series of foreign policy objectives: (i) re-invigorate bilateral relations with the US and Europe, (ii) revise the foundations of Mercosur, evaluating (together with Brazil) alternatives that imply more free trade and (iii) go back to a single exchange rate, allow for a revival of commodity exports and attract foreign direct investment.
