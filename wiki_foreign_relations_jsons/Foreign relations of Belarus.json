"{{Short description|none}}\n<!-- \"none\" is preferred when the title is sufficiently descriptive; see [[WP:SDNONE]] -->\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n\n{{Politics of Belarus}}\nThe [[Byelorussian SSR]] was one of only two [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] republics to be separate members of the [[United Nations]] (the other being the [[Ukrainian SSR]]). Both republics and the [[Soviet Union]] joined the UN when the organization was founded in 1945.\n\n==Prior to 2001==\nAfter the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], at which time Belarus gained its independence, Belarus became a member of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS), the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE), [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]], the [[North Atlantic Cooperation Council]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[World Bank]]. The adoption by Supreme Council of the BSSR of the declaration of State Sovereignty of Belarus in 1990 was a turning point on the development of the state. It has also been [[Union State|in a supranational union with Russia]] since 2 April 1996, although this has had little practical effect. [[Belarus-Council of Europe relations]] are based on cooperation and it is not a member (like Russia).\n\n===Belarus–Russia relations===\n{{further|Foreign relations of Russia towards Belarus}}\nThe introduction of [[free trade]] between Russia and Belarus in mid-1995 led to a spectacular growth in bilateral trade, which was only temporarily reversed due to the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]]. President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] sought to develop a closer relationship with Russia. The framework for the Union of Russia and Belarus was set out in the Treaty on the Formation of a Community of Russia and Belarus (1996), the Treaty on Russia-Belarus Union, the Union Charter (1997), and the Treaty of the Formation of a Union State (1999). The integration treaties contained commitments to [[monetary union]], [[civil rights|equal rights]], single citizenship, and a common defence and [[foreign policy]].\n\n===Belarus–European Union relations===\n{{Main|Belarus–European Union relations}}\nFollowing the recognition of Belarus as an independent state in December 1991 by the [[European Community]], EC/EU-Belarus relations initially experienced a steady progress. The signature of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) in 1995 signaled a commitment to political, economic and trade cooperation. Some assistance was provided to Belarus within the framework of the [[TACIS]] programme and also through various aid programs and loans. However, progress in EU-Belarus relations stalled in 1996 after serious setbacks to the development of democracy, and the [[Drazdy conflict]].\n\nThe EU did not recognize the 1996 constitution, which replaced the 1994 constitution. The [[Council of the European Union]] decided against Belarus in 1997: The PCA was not concluded, nor was its trade-related part; Belarusian membership in the [[Council of Europe]] was not supported; bilateral relations at the ministerial level were suspended and EU technical assistance programs were frozen.\n\nAcknowledging the lack of progress in relation to bilateral relations and the internal situation following the position adopted in 1997, the EU adopted a step-by-step approach in 1999, whereby sanctions would be gradually lifted upon fulfillment of the four benchmarks set by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]. In 2000, some moderately positive developments toward the implementation of recommendations made by the OSCE AMG were observed but were not sufficient in the realm of access to fair and free elections.\n\nAccording to the European Commission's website, as of 2025, \"The EU has not yet ratified the bilateral Partnership and Cooperation Agreement concluded with Belarus in 1995, due to Belarus' lack of commitment to democracy, and political and civil rights. The bilateral trade and economic relations therefore remain covered by the [[EEC-Euratom-Soviet Union Agreement on trade and commercial and economic cooperation|Trade and Cooperation Agreement concluded by the European Community with the Soviet Union]] in 1989, and subsequently endorsed by Belarus.\"<ref>{{cite web | title=EU trade relations with Belarus | date=3 July 2024 | url=https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/eu-trade-relationships-country-and-region/countries-and-regions/belarus_en }}</ref>\n\n===Belarus–United Kingdom relations===\n{{Main|Belarus–United Kingdom relations}}\nBelarus established [[Foreign relations of the United Kingdom|diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom]] on 27 January 1992.<ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite web |title=Political Dialogue |url=https://uk.mfa.gov.by/en/bilateral_relations/political/|website=[[Embassy of Belarus, London|Embassy of Belarus in the United Kingdom]]|access-date=10 March 2025|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250114101720/https://uk.mfa.gov.by/en/bilateral_relations/political/|archive-date=14 January 2025|url-status=live}}</ref> \n* Belarus maintains an [[Embassy of Belarus, London|embassy]] in [[London]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |author=Diplomat Magazine|date=20 May 2019|url=https://diplomatmagazine.com/heads-of-mission/europe/belarus/|title=Belarus|website=Diplomat Magazine|access-date=10 March 2025|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250304223424/https://diplomatmagazine.com/heads-of-mission/europe/belarus/|archive-date=4 March 2025|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* The United Kingdom is accredited to Belarus through its embassy in Minsk.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-minsk|title=British Embassy Minsk|website=[[gov.uk|GOV.UK]]|access-date=10 March 2025|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250306110559/https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-minsk|archive-date=6 March 2025|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoth countries share common membership of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]].

Although there has been some American direct private investment in Belarus, its development has been relatively slow given the uncertain pace of reform. An Overseas Private Investment Corporation agreement was signed in June 1992 but has been suspended since 1995 because Belarus did not fulfill its obligations under the agreement.\n\nBelarus is eligible for [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]] short-term financing [[insurance]] for U.S. investments, but because of the adverse business climate, no projects have been initiated. The IMF granted standby credit in September 1995, but Belarus has fallen off the program and did not receive the second tranche of funding, which had been scheduled for regular intervals throughout 1996.\n\nThe United States - along with the European Union - has restricted the travel of President Alexander Lukashenko and members of his inner circle, as well as imposing economic sanctions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17941637|title=Belarus profile - Timeline|date=2016-09-20|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-26}}</ref>\n\n===Belarus–Baltic relations===\n\n{{Further|Belarus-Estonia relations}}, {{Further|Belarus-Latvia relations}}, {{Further|Belarus-Lithuania relations}}\n\n==Present situation (2001 onwards)==\n{{update|section|date=May 2021}}\n\n===Relations with the European Union===\n{{main|Belarus–European Union relations}}\nThe structure of Belarus trade reflects the low competitiveness and output decline of manufacturing industry in the country over the past decade, leading to the predominance of primary production, work-intensive goods as exports. Belarusian exports to the EU consist mainly of agricultural and textile products, while imports from the EU are primarily machinery.\n\nBelarus is a beneficiary of the EU's Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). The European Commission decided in 2003 to initiate an investigation into violations of freedom of association in Belarus as the first step towards a possible temporary withdrawal of the GSP from Belarus.\n\nIn December 2004, the EU adopted a position aimed at imposing travel restrictions on officials from Belarus responsible for the fraudulent parliamentary elections and referendum on 17 October 2004, and for human rights violations during subsequent peaceful political demonstrations in [[Minsk]].\nThe [[European Parliament]] released a statement in March 2005 in which it denounced the Belarusian government as a dictatorship. The European parliamentarians were primarily concerned about the suppression of independent media outlets in the country and the fraudulent referendum. A resolution of the European Parliament declared that the personal bank accounts of President Lukashenko and other high-ranking Belarusian officials should be tracked and frozen.\n\nIn 2005, [[Amnesty International]] reported a ''pattern of deliberate obstruction, harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders'' in Belarus. [[Reporters Without Borders]] accused the Belarusian authorities of hounding and arresting journalists from the country's Polish minority. Lukashenko has closed the country's main Polish newspaper, printing a bogus paper instead with the same name and size that praises his incumbent government. Several foreign, mainly Polish, journalists have been arrested or expelled from the country. Lukashenko accused Poland of an attempt to overthrow his government by stirring up a peaceful revolution in Belarus comparable to the [[Orange Revolution]] in [[Ukraine]] in 2004.\n\nLater in 2005 the Belarusian [[riot police]] seized the headquarters of the [[Union of Poles in Belarus]], an association representing the 400,000 [[ethnic minority]] Polish living in western areas the country that were part of Poland until [[World War II]]. The dispute between Poland and Belarus escalated further as Poland responded by recalling its ambassador from Belarus for indefinite consultations, and called on the European Union to impose sanctions on the Belarusian leadership in order to curtail the [[human rights]] abuses in Belarus. Belarusian papers described this as a 'dirty political game', and part of a 'cold war' waged on president Lukashenko. Polish Foreign Minister [[Adam Rotfeld]] said a clampdown was under way, aimed at destroying ''\"all elements of political pluralism and independence\"'' in Belarus.\n\n[[File:European Union Eastern Partnership.svg|thumb|Members of the Eastern Partnership]]\n\nIn August 2005 the EU's executive commission called for human rights to be respected in Belarus. The commission said it was considering offering support to independent media in the country and had set aside more than eight million euros from its budget to offer support for human rights activities. France expressed her solidarity with Poland on the issue of human rights in Belarus a day after the EU declared it was worried about the situation in that country. Several former Soviet Republics, including neighbouring Ukraine, also expressed their concerns about the development of the situation in Belarus.\n\nIn May 2009 Belarus and the EU agree on cooperation in the [[Eastern Partnership]] (EaP). However, it is contended by some scholars that the (EaP) is unable to create a workable partnership.<ref name=Korosteleva2008>[[Elena Korosteleva]], \"The Limits of the EU Governance: Belarus ' Response to the European Neighbourhood Policy\", Contemporary Politics, Vol. 15(2), June 2009, pp. 229–45</ref> This proved to be correct when Belarus withdrew from the Partnership on 30 September 2011.<ref name=\"Belarus Withdrawal\">[http://www.euractiv.com/europes-east/belarus-quits-eus-eastern-partnership-initiative-news-508050 Belarus quits EU's Eastern Partnership initiative] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002084121/http://www.euractiv.com/europes-east/belarus-quits-eus-eastern-partnership-initiative-news-508050 |archive-date=2011-10-02|website=www.euractiv.com|access-date= 2011-10-30}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2012, Belarus expelled all [[Sweden|Swedish]] diplomats, including the Swedish Ambassador to Belarus, Stefan Eriksson, and closed its embassy in [[Stockholm]], after a Swedish [[public relations]] firm released [[teddy bear]]s carrying pro-democracy flyers in parachutes from an airplane over Minsk on 4 July 2012. Lukashenko also fired his air defence chief and the head of the border guards over the incident. Their replacements have been told not to hesitate to use force to stop future intrusions from abroad.<ref name=\"Belarus Sweden\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19176432 Belarus-Sweden teddy bear row escalates], ''[[BBC News]]'', 2012-08-08</ref>\n\n===Relations with Russia===\n{{main|Belarus–Russia relations}}\nRussia remains the largest and most important partner for Belarus both in the political and economic fields. After protracted disputes and setbacks, the two countries' [[customs union|customs duties were unified]] in March 2001 but the customs controls were soon restored. In terms of trade, almost half of Belarusian export goes to Russia. Due to the structure of Belarusian [[Industrial sector|industry]], Belarus relies heavily on Russia both for export markets and for the supply of [[raw material]]s and components.\n\nAfter initial negotiation with the [[Central Bank of the Russian Federation|Russian Central Bank]] on [[monetary union]], the [[Russian ruble]] was set to be introduced in Belarus in 2004, but this was postponed first until 2005, then until 2006, and now seems to have been suspended indefinitely.\n\n===Relations with the United States===\n{{Main|Belarus–United States relations}}\nBelarus has had an ongoing discussion to relaunch IMF-backed reforms, concluding an arrangement for an IMF Staff-monitored program (SMP) in 2001. However, the authorities did not follow through with reforms as hoped, leaving an uncertain future for IMF-backed cooperation. Belarus authorities have said on several occasions that they find IMF intervention and recommendations in Belarus counter-productive to the economic development of those countries.\nThe relationships with the United States have been further strained, after [[Congress of the United States]] unanimously passed the [[Belarus Democracy Act of 2004]].\n\nOn 7 March 2008 the government of Belarus ejected US Ambassador [[Karen B. Stewart]] from the country, following a row over travel restrictions placed on President Lukashenko and sanctions against state-owned chemical company [[Belneftekhim]]. The Belarusian Foreign Ministry announced at the same time that it was recalling its own ambassador to the US. This was followed by the expulsion of ten other U.S. embassy staff from Minsk in late April. At the same time the government of Belarus ordered the U.S. Embassy in Minsk to cut its staff by half.<ref name=\"aljazeera1\">{{Cite web\n|url = http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2008/04/200861503523435683.html\n|title = Belarus expels US diplomats\n|access-date = 2009-01-02\n|date= 1 May 2008\n|publisher=Al Jazeera\n}}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes1\">{{cite news\n|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EFDA1E3FF936A15750C0A96E9C8B63\n|title = Belarus: U.S. Cuts Embassy Staff\n|access-date = 2009-01-02\n|author=Michael Schwartz\n|date = 25 March 2008\n|work=The New York Times\n}}</ref><ref name=\"moscowtimes1\">{{Cite web\n|url = http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/1010/42/361246.htm\n|title = U.S. Ambassador Leaving Belarus\n|access-date = 2009-01-02\n|author = Andrei Makhovsky\n|date = 13 March 2008\n|publisher = The Moscow Times.com\n|archive-date = 5 September 2008\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080905104549/http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/1010/42/361246.htm\n|url-status = dead\n}}</ref> A [[White House]] spokesman described the expulsion as \"deeply disappointing\".\n\n===Relations with other countries===\nDue to strained relations with the United States and the European Union, as well as occasional high-level disputes with Russia over prices on core imported natural resources such as oil and gas, Belarus aims to develop better relations with countries in other regions, like the Middle East, Asia, and [[Latin America]].<ref>Rafal Czachor, Polityka wielowektorowości Republiki Białoruś – geneza, podstawy konceptualne, przykłady realizacji, Wrocławski Przegląd Międzynarodowy, Vol. 1, 2011, pp.54-56, {{ISSN|1898-0317}}</ref>\n\n====Hong Kong national security law====\nBelarus was one of 53 countries that in June 2020 supported the [[2020 Hong Kong national security law|Hong Kong national security law]] at the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lawler |first1=Dave |title= The 53 countries supporting China's crackdown on Hong Kong|url= https://www.axios.com/countries-supporting-china-hong-kong-law-0ec9bc6c-3aeb-4af0-8031-aa0f01a46a7c.html|website=[[Axios (website)|Axios]] |access-date=3 July 2020 |language=en |date=2 July 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Nuclear weapons offer===\nIn May 2023, the President of Belarus offered nuclear weapons to other countries who join Belarus and Russia.\n<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/28/europe/lukashenko-nuclear-weapons-belarus-russia-intl-hnk/index.html | title=Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko offers nuclear weapons to nations willing 'to join the Union State of Russia and Belarus' | website=[[CNN]] | date=29 May 2023 }}</ref>\n\n==Diplomatic relations==\nList of countries which Belarus maintains diplomatic relations with:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |[[File:Diplomatic relations of Belarus.svg|frameless|425x425px]]\n|-\n! # !!
