Iraq was a British protectorate under a mandate from the [[League of Nations]] between 1921 and 1932, then effectively gained its independence with the [[14 July Revolution|1958 revolution]] which overthrew the pro-Western royal family and established the Republic.\n\nIraq is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Arab League]] (of which it is a founding member) since 1945, the [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (of which it is also a founding member) since 1960, and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] since 1976. The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 661|international trade embargo on Iraq between 1990 and 2003]] in retaliation for the [[Invasion of Kuwait|invasion of Kuwait]] by [[Saddam Hussein]] allowed it to relatively spare its oil reserves compared to other countries in the region. Like Saudi Arabia, one of its other major resources is the presence of [[Islamic holy sites]] on its territory which attracts millions of pilgrims each year (mainly Iranians): the [[Imam Ali Shrine|shrine of Ali]] in [[Najaf]] and the city of [[Karbala]].\n\nThe Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs is the Kurd [[Fuad Hussein]], since June 2020. This position is strategic for Iraq, which largely depends on its foreign relations for its economy and security, after being the scene of a [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–2017)|particularly violent civil war]] between 2013 and 2017.\n\nBut Iraq is also a battleground between foreign powers vying to extend their influence in the Middle East, mainly Iran, the United States, Turkey, and to a lesser extent, Saudi Arabia. Unlike [[Syria]], its bordering neighbor, these foreign powers avoid military confrontations on Iraqi soil (with the notable exception of the [[Killing of Qasem Soleimani|elimination]] of the Iranian general [[Qasem Soleimani]] by an American strike in Baghdad in 2020) and prefer political and commercial struggles.\n\nThus, the formation of various Iraqi governments is often the result of a compromise integrating Iranian, American, and Turkish concerns, ensuring that Iraq's foreign policy will not be unfavorable to them. It must also be representative of its multi-ethnic and multi-denominational population, while the [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] sectarianism of [[Nouri al-Maliki]], Prime Minister from 2006 to 2014, is considered one of the main causes of the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–2017)|second Iraqi civil war]]. This war saw, like the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]], the intervention in Iraq of a vast international military coalition led by the United States, this time in support of the Iraqi government, which allowed it to regain control of the entire territory in 2017.\n\nSince then, Iraq has gradually pursued its global reintegration, being the subject of several international conferences in August 2021 and December 2022 aimed at supporting Baghdad on economic, diplomatic, and security levels. Several Arab and Western countries participate, while this summit also aims to promote dialogue between regional stakeholders.\n\n== Chronology of relations ==\n=== 1932 to 1958 ===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Iraq}}\nIn 1921, the British, victors of the [[Mesopotamian campaign]] (Iraqi theater of [[World War I]]), established a [[protectorate]] over Iraq which they transformed into a [[constitutional

In the Sumerian Babylonian era, Iran was subject to the first Iraqi empires, and religions prior to monotheistic cults left a deep imprint there<ref name=\":14\" />. Subsequently, the rise of the Persian Empire led in 639 BC to the occupation of [[Babylon]]<ref name=\":14\" />. A few years after the [[Hijrah]], these lands, Iraqi first, then Iranian, yielded to the first [[Muslim conquests]] before entering the fold of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] encompassing Persia, the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the [[Maghreb]], with [[Baghdad]] as capital<ref name=\":14\" />. The border between Iran and Iraq was drawn at the beginning of the 16th century with the emergence of the [[Safavid Empire]] on the current territory of Iran, while Iraq was integrated into the Ottoman Empire<ref name=\":14\" />.\n\nAfter World War I, while Iraq separated from the Ottoman Empire and became a [[Kingdom of Iraq|British protectorate]], Iran, feeling competed by this new national entity, was the only country to abstain from recognizing this new established state until 1929<ref name=\":14\" />. From the 1930s, the two countries ultimately became allies, both governed by pro-Western monarchies, and signatories in 1955 to the [[Baghdad Pact]], (from which Iraq withdrew in 1959 following the [[14 July Revolution|Iraqi revolution]])<ref name=\":50\" />. At the beginning of the 1970s, however, the two states opposed each other during the [[Dhofar War]] (1964-1976), in which Iran intervened massively alongside the pro-British Sultan [[Qaboos bin Said]] from 1973, while the Ba'athist Iraqi regime supported the Marxist rebellion<ref>{{cite web |author=Lisa Romeo |title=Guerre du Dhofar (1964-1976) |trans-title=Dhofar War (1964-1976) |url=https://www.lesclesdumoyenorient.com/Guerre-du-Dhofar-1964-1976.html |website=Les clés du Moyen-Orient |date=9 April 2011|access-date=30 October 2025 }}</ref>.\n\nThe [[Iran–Iraq border|border]] that currently separates Iraq and Iran as independent states measures 1,458 kilometers and was approved by the [[Algiers Agreement (1975)|Algiers Agreements]] signed in 1975<ref name=\":44\" />. The objective of this treaty is for Iraq to convince Iran to cease its support for Kurdish autonomists, in exchange for Iraq's recognition of the borders of the [[Shatt al-Arab]] (favorable to Iran)<ref name=\":310\" />. Deprived of Iranian support, the Kurds of Iraq lay down their arms and accept a peace agreement proposed a year earlier by the government<ref name=\":310\" />.\n\nIn 1979, the Iranian monarchy was in turn overthrown by a [[Iranian Revolution|popular uprising]] after which Saddam Hussein decided to renege on the Algiers Agreements and invade Iran<ref name=\":23\" />.\n==== Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) ====\n{{Main|Iran–Iraq War}}\n\nWhen Saddam Hussein attacked Iran in September 1980, he declared three conquest objectives<ref name=\":42\" />: occupy the [[Shatt al-Arab]] (delta of the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]), the \"river of the Arabs\", which he had to share with Iran in 1975; make the ''Khalidj al-Farsi'', the [[Persian Gulf]], the ''Khalidj al-Arabi'', the \"Arabian Gulf\", by driving the [[Iran|Iranians]] from the islets that control access to the [[Strait of Hormuz]]; seize the oil-rich province of [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]], named by Arab nationalists, the ''Arabistan''.\n\n[[File:Khorramshahr POWs crop.jpg|thumb|Capture of Iraqi soldiers [[Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas|after the recapture by the Iranians of Khorramshahr]].|alt=Captive soldiers in single file.]]\nOne can add to this Saddam Hussein's fear of seeing the revolution of Iran's Shiites spread to Iraq, where Shiite Muslims represent 60% of the population without being associated with the government, and are perceived as a threat by the power<ref name=\":310\" />.\n\nAs early as 1982, noting the failure of his offensive, Baghdad tried to end the conflict, but the ceasefire was only accepted six years later by Iran under military pressure from the United States whose fleet was very present in the Gulf<ref name=\":87\" />. The war thus ended in 1988 and resulted in a territorial ''status quo'', but the [[Economy of Iraq|Iraqi economy]] emerged in ruins, with an external debt of more than 70 billion dollars (half of which owed to the Gulf States), and a reconstruction cost estimated at 60 billion dollars<ref name=\":23\" />. It also gave Iran the opportunity to establish influence over part of Iraqi society by welcoming, training, and enlisting opponents: the Kurds, and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq and its armed branch, and the Badr organization from which a large contingent of high-ranking Iraqi state officials today originate<ref name=\":23\">{{cite web|title=Ennemi juré devenu grand frère : en 40 ans, l'Iran a transformé ses relations avec l'Irak|trans-title=Sworn enemy become big brother: in 40 years, Iran has transformed its relations with Iraq|url=https://www.lorientlejour.com/article/1233343/ennemi-jure-devenu-grand-frere-en-40-ans-liran-a-transforme-ses-relations-avec-lirak.html|website=L'Orient-Le Jour|date=21 September 2020|access-date=30 October 2025}}.</ref>.\n\nOn 15 August 1990, Saddam Hussein, in turn diplomatically isolated following the invasion of Kuwait ten days earlier, renewed ties with Iran, and proposed to it the reapplication of the Algiers Agreement<ref name=\":310\" />.

In the following years, diplomatic relations between Baghdad and Cairo improved with numerous high officials from the two countries making cross visits<ref name=\":99\" />. [[File:AbdelFattah Elsisi.jpg|thumb|Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Egyptian president since 2014]]\nOn 27 June 2021, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi went to Baghdad, becoming the first Egyptian head of state to go to Iraq since the break in diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1990<ref name=\":99\" />. He met Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi and King Abdallah <abbr>II</abbr> of Jordan in the framework of a tripartite summit between their three countries, focusing on political and economic cooperation, investments, and the fight against terrorism<ref name=\":99\" />. This meeting was motivated by the observation that an alliance between Egypt which has significant military capabilities, Iraq which has considerable oil resources and Jordan rich in its human capital is promising if these countries capitalize on their complementarity<ref name=\":100\" />. Several cooperation agreements were signed in the sectors of energy, health and education<ref name=\":100\" />. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Mustafa Al-Kadhimi and King Abdallah <abbr>II</abbr> met again in Baghdad in August 2021 during an expanded Middle East summit including France, focused on security and regional economic development<ref name=\":104\" />.\n\nIn addition to better economic cooperation, this Cairo-Baghdad-Amman axis was also motivated by shared geopolitical interests by the three countries: to counterbalance the influence of Iran, Turkey and the pro-American Gulf monarchies (mainly Saudi Arabia) in regional affairs<ref name=\":100\" />. Indeed, these three countries have in common the desire to regain regional influence after having been sidelined by Donald Trump's policy in the Middle East, ultra-favorable to Israel, Turkey (via NATO and the friendly relations between Trump and Erdogan) and the Gulf monarchies<ref name=\":100\" />.\n\nIn December 2022, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi participated in the second Baghdad conference in Jordan, and affirmed \"Egypt's refusal of any external intervention in Iraq\"<ref name=\":132\" />. \n\n=== Relations with Libya ===\nIraq and Libya are both members of the Arab League (Libya was the first non-founding country to join in 1953), of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\nIf these two countries had few direct interactions, they shared a common history, notably in their respective independences obtained by the overthrow of pro-British monarchies (in 1958 for Iraq and 1969 for Libya), and their adherence to [[Pan-Arabism]] and [[Nasserism]] during their \"[[decolonization|post-colonial]]\" years. The Libyan officer [[Muammar Gaddafi]], author of the [[1969 Libyan coup d'état|military coup]] that overthrew King [[Idris of Libya|Idris I]], considered himself a disciple then heir of Nasser, who died a year after his takeover<ref name=\":147\">{{cite news|language=fr|title=L'histoire incroyable de Mouamar Kadhafi et ce que la Libye est devenue 10 ans après sa mort|trans-title=The incredible story of Muammar Gaddafi and what Libya has become 10 years after his death|newspaper=BBC News Afrique|date=20 October 2021|url=https://www.bbc.com/afrique/region-58983057|access-date=30 October 2025}}</ref>.

The two countries were also very hostile to Israel, and both condemned the [[Camp David Accords|Israeli-Egyptian peace accords]] of 1978 by excluding Egypt from the Arab League, and by breaking their diplomatic relations with Cairo<ref name=\":38\" />.\n\nIn the following years, while Muammar Gaddafi's hostility towards his Egyptian counterpart radicalized, Saddam Hussein played appeasement, recognizing Egypt's support in its war against Iran<ref name=\":36\" />. In addition to this diplomatic divergence, the two countries found themselves indirectly enemies in the [[Chadian–Libyan conflict]] (from 1978 to 1987), and in the Iran–Iraq War (1980-1988), during which the two Arab leaders, simultaneously at war, supported each other's enemies<ref name=\":148\" /><ref>{{cite web |language=fr |author=Benjamin Tremblay |title=Comment l'Occident a détruit la Libye {{!}} Documentaire {{!}} Partie 1 |trans-title=How the West destroyed Libya!

In doing so, having made the strategic decision to orient a significant part of its maritime trade towards the area whose access is controlled by the Kuwaiti islands, Iraq backed down from its absolute intransigence on the Shatt al-Arab file without Tehran having retreated from its position<ref name=\":87\" />. One can then wonder if at the end of hostilities with Iran, Saddam Hussein had not already made the decision, while yielding to Iranian demands on the Shatt al-Arab, to invade Kuwait to gain access to the coveted islands<ref name=\":87\" />.\n\nSince the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003, although the Iraqi government has renounced its expansionist policy on Kuwait and Iran, conflicts remain between Iraq and its neighbors over their maritime sovereignty and competition between their port infrastructures<ref name=\":75\" />.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Iran–Iraq War]]\n* [[Gulf War]]\n*
