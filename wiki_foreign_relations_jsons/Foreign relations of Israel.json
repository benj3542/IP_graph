Israel's foreign policy goals have therefore been to overcome diplomatic isolation and to achieve recognition and friendly relations with as many nations as possible, both in the Middle East region and further afield. Israel practices both open and secret diplomacy to further national goals, for example, [[Economy of Israel|commercial trade]] and [[Science and technology in Israel|science and technology cooperation]], importing raw materials, engaging in [[Military Procurement|military procurement]] as well as [[Arms industry of Israel|exporting arms]] and military assistance, intelligence cooperation with its allies, and prisoner-of-war exchanges and other arrangements for hostage releases. It has also sought to foster increased [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]] to Israel and to protect vulnerable Jewish communities in the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]], to offer [[Israeli foreign aid|aid to developing countries]] and humanitarian assistance to countries facing large-scale disasters.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Chapin Metz |editor1-first=Helen |editor1-link=Helen Chapin Metz |title=Israel: A Country Study |date=1988 |publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>\n\nIsrael's close friendship with the United States has been a linchpin of its foreign policy since the establishment of the state. Until the [[Iranian Revolution]] and the fall of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1979, Israel and Iran maintained close ties.

After the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] occurred as a result of a series of political upheavals and conflicts Croatia declared independence on 8 October 1991 and officially renewed its bilateral relations with Israel which recognized Croatia as an independent state on 16 April 1992, but due to some disagreements with the Croatian President [[Franjo Tuđman|Tuđman]] full diplomatic relations were established 5 years later, on 4 September 1997. Since then relations between Croatia and Israel have been excellent. Croatia has an embassy in [[Tel Aviv]] and 4 honorary consulates (in [[Ashdod]], [[Caesarea (modern town)|Caesarea]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Kfar Shmaryahu]]). Israel has an embassy in [[Zagreb]].

Israel and Cyprus' associations have continued to expand since 1960, the year of Cyprus' independence. The neighboring countries trade regularly and there are high flows of tourism between them. However, Cypriot politicians have frequently spoken out against Israeli military raids in the Palestinian territories as well as the 2006 Lebanon War, during which Cyprus was forced to manage a heavy flow of refugees and aid out of and into Lebanon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/cyprus.html |title=The Virtual Jewish History Tour: Cyprus |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=May 2022}}\n\nHowever, the discovery of natural gas in the [[Leviathan gas field]] led to a thawing of relations between the two governments. The two countries demarcated their Exclusive Economic Zones in 2010. Israel's rising antagonism with Turkey further increased the level of cooperation between the two countries, as Israel compensated by improving its relations elsewhere. In February 2012, Netanyahu visited Cyprus, the first visit of an Israeli Prime Minister in history.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2012/02/israel-and-cyprus?zid=309&ah=80dcf288b8561b012f603b9fd9577f0e |title=Getting friendly |newspaper=The Economist |date=18 February 2012 |access-date=23 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nRelations between Israel and Cyprus are based on mutual respect for Western values, the support for free-market economy and the establishment of democracies in the Middle East that would co-exist peacefully.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=41145604|title=The State, Ethnic Relations and Democratic Stability: Lebanon, Cyprus and Israel|first=Oren|last=Yiftachel|date=1 January 1992|journal=GeoJournal|volume=28|issue=3|pages=319–332|doi=10.1007/BF00817909|bibcode=1992GeoJo..28..319Y |s2cid=189880356}}</ref>\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\n{{Main|Czech Republic–Israel relations}}\n\nIsrael and the Czech Republic share a special relationship.

No country agreed to help, except Israel. Israel saw it as an opportunity to thank the Czechs for training Israeli pilots when the country was first established.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/index_view.php?id=350692 |title=Czech pilots train in Israel for Afghan mission&nbsp;– ČeskéNoviny.cz |publisher=Ceskenoviny.cz}}</ref>\n\n=== Denmark ===\n{{Main|Denmark–Israel relations}}\n\nThe relations between Denmark and Israel have been friendly and warm. Denmark voted for the [[partition of Palestine]] in 1947 and supports Israel in the [[United Nations]]. Denmark was one of few countries in Europe to [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|save most of its Jewish population]] during the WWII. In [[Jerusalem]], there is a monument to the rescue of [[Danish Jews]], a school is named in Denmark's honor, and the King [[Christian X]] hospital in [[Eitanim]] is named after Denmark's king during World War II. Denmark has an embassy in Israel, and Israel has an embassy in Copenhagen.\n\nThe political lives of the two states have been somewhat intertwined: The former Israeli minister of social and diaspora affairs [[Michael Melchior]] was born in Denmark and is the son of former chief rabbi in Copenhagen, [[Bent Melchior]], the nephew of former Danish minister of traffic and minister of tourism and communication [[Arne Melchior]], and the grandson of the acting rabbi for the Jewish refugees from Denmark in Sweden 1943–45, [[Marcus Melchior]]; the executive director of the [[Peres Center for Peace]] 2001–2011, [[Ron Pundak]] who played an important role in starting the [[Oslo peace process]] and was part of the core group behind the [[Geneva Initiative]], is the son of the influential Danish journalist [[Herbert Pundik]]; and the prominent Israeli politician [[Yohanan Plesner]], former chairman of the [[Plesner Committee]], is the son of Danish architect [[Ulrik Plesner]].\n\n=== Estonia ===\nEstonia and Israel maintain excellent relations.

In 1947, during discussions at the United Nations about the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]], the Vatican supported the [[internationalization of Jerusalem]], in order to keep the [[holy places]] away from either Israeli or Arab sovereignty. In October 1948, as the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] was in progress, [[Pope Pius XII]], deeply disturbed by that violent conflict, issued the [[encyclical]] ''[[In multiplicibus curis]]'', in which he called on the peace-makers to give Jerusalem and its outskirts \"an international character\" and to assure&nbsp;– \"with international guarantees\"&nbsp;– freedom of access and worship at the holy places scattered throughout Palestine. In April 1949, he issued the encyclical ''[[Redemptoris nostri cruciatus]]'', in which he appealed for justice for the [[Palestinian refugee]]s and repeated his call for an \"international status\" as the best form of protection for the holy places.\n\nIn January 1964, Pope [[Paul VI]] visited Israel, the first such Papal visit.\n\nFollowing the [[Six-Day War]], the Vatican modified its position on the holy places. In an address to the [[College of Cardinals]] in December 1967, [[Pope Paul VI]] called for a \"''special statute'', internationally guaranteed\" for Jerusalem and the Holy Places, thus changing the previous demand for the internationalization of Jerusalem.\n\nDiplomatic relations between the Israeli government and the Vatican were established in 1994, following the conclusion of the [[Fundamental Agreement between the Holy See and the State of Israel]], signed on 30 December 1993. The Holy See (the Vatican), which has UN observer status, is the only non-UN member state with which Israel has diplomatic relations and the only non-UN member state recognised by Israel.
