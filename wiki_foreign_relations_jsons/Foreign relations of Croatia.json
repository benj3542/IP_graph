"{{Short description|none}}\n<!-- \"none\" is preferred when the title is sufficiently descriptive; see [[WP:SDNONE]] -->\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{Politics of Croatia}}\n\nThe foreign relations of [[Croatia]] are primarily formulated and executed via [[Government of Croatia|its government]] which guides the state's interactions with other nations, their citizens, and foreign organizations. Active in global affairs since the 9th century, modern Croatian diplomacy is considered to have formed following the [[independence of Croatia]] in 1991. As a modern state, Croatia established diplomatic relations with most world nations – [[List of diplomatic relations of Croatia|189 states in total]] – during the 1990s, starting [[Croatia–Germany relations|with Germany]] (1991) and most recently [[Foreign relations of Liberia|with Liberia]] (2024). Croatia has friendly relations with most of its neighboring countries, namely [[Croatia–Italy relations|Italy]], [[Croatia–Slovenia relations|Slovenia]], [[Croatia–Hungary relations|Hungary]], and [[Croatia–Montenegro relations|Montenegro]]. They maintain colder, more tense relations with [[Croatia–Serbia relations|Serbia]] as well as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina–Croatia relations|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] due to historic nation-building conflict and differing political ideologies. It maintains a special relationship with both [[Albania–Croatia relations|Albania]] and [[Croatia–Kosovo relations|Kosovo]].<!-- Citations are in body of article per MOS:LEADCITE.   -->\n\nCroatia is seen as a stabilizing influence in [[Southeast Europe]] due to its political alignment with the [[Western world]]. It maintains strong relations with the [[Croatia–United States relations|United States]], the [[Croatia–United Kingdom relations|United Kingdom]], and the [[European Union]] (E.U.), joining the organization [[2013 enlargement of the European Union|in 2013]]. Croatia is a close military ally to the U.S. and Europe through its membership in [[NATO]], having joined [[Member states of NATO|in 2009]]. The [[economy of Croatia]] is one of the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)#Table|largest in Southeast Europe]] with Croatia maintaining a relatively [[Armed Forces of Croatia|large military presence]] in the region. Its strong [[Atlanticism|Euro-Atlantic alignment]] has been used to advance Western cultural, political, and economic synergy across Southeast Europe. Croatia is a member of the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Council of Europe]], the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), [[Union for the Mediterranean]], among other international organizations. \n\nTheir foreign policy objectives have shifted since the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. During the 1990s, Croatia sought to gain international recognition and join the [[United Nations]] (2000), later seeking entry into NATO (2009) and the European Union (2013). Modern policy objectives are regional stabilization, influence in international organizations, and strengthening multilateral cooperation. Limited succession issues following the 1991-92 [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|dissolution of Yugoslavia]] continue to complicate regional relations. Croatia has outstanding border disputes, sovereign ownership issues, and treaty disagreements with multiple neighbors. [[Croatian nationalism]] influences regional geopolitics.  \n\n==History==\n[[File:Rudjer Boskovic.jpg|thumb|Croatian-Italian diplomat [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]], 1760]]\nThe first native Croatian ruler recognised by the Pope was duke [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]], who received papal recognition from [[Pope John VIII]] on 7 June 879.<ref name=\"Mužić\">{{cite book|first=Ivan|last=Mužić|title=Hrvatska povijest devetoga stoljeća|trans-title=Croatian Ninth Century History|language=hr|url=http://www.muzic-ivan.info/hrvatska_povijest.pdf|isbn=978-953-263-034-3|year=2007|publisher=Naklada Bošković|access-date=14 October 2011|archive-date=8 August 2019|pages=195–198|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808024028/http://www.muzic-ivan.info/hrvatska_povijest.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] was the first [[king of Croatia]], noted as such in a letter of [[Pope John X]] in 925.

A significant part of the country was outside of the control of the central government with the declaration of self-proclaimed unrecognized [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]]. In 1992 signing of the [[Sarajevo Agreement]] led to the cease-fire to allow [[UNPROFOR]] deployment in the country. Diplomatic efforts led to unsuccessful proposals which included the [[Daruvar Agreement]] and [[Z-4 Plan]]. In 1995 [[United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia|UNCRO]] mission took over the UNPROFOR mandate yet soon after [[Operation Storm]] led to a [[decisive victory]] for the [[Croatian Army]] with only the [[Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia (1995–1998)|Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia]] remaining initially as a rump territory of Krajina. A diplomatic solution that avoided conflict in Eastern Slavonia was reached on 12 November 1995 via the signing of the [[Erdut Agreement]] with significant support and facilitation from the [[international community]] (primarily the [[United States]], and with [[United Nations]] and various [[Europe]]an actors).<ref name=\"Put do Erduta\">{{cite journal | title = Put do Erduta-Položaj Hrvatske u međunarodnoj zajednici 1994.-1995. i reintegracija hrvatskog Podunavlja | first = Albert | last = Bing | journal = Scrinia Slavonica | volume = 7 | pages = 371–404 | publisher = Hrvatski institut za povijest | location = Zagreb | year = 2007 | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=42842&lang=en }}</ref><ref name=\"Srpska oblast 1\">{{cite journal | title = Srpska oblast Istočna Slavonija, Baranja i Zapadni Srijem – od \"Oluje\" do dovršetka mirne reintegracije hrvatskog Podunavlja (prvi dio) | first = Nikica | last = Barić | journal = Scrinia Slavonica | volume = 11 | pages = 393–451 | publisher = Hrvatski institut za povijest | location = Zagreb | year = 2011 | url = https://hrcak.srce.hr/en/clanak/116220 }}</ref> Temporary [[UNTAES]] administration over the region opened the way for the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] which ended the [[Bosnian War]].

The progress was nevertheless slow in the period between 1996 and 1999 with rising concerns over authoritarian tendencies in the country. In order to gain access to European and [[Transatlantic relations|trans-Atlantic]] institutions, it has had to undo many negative effects of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and the war that ensued, and improve and maintain good relations with its neighbours. Croatia has had an uneven record in these areas between 1996 and 1999 during the right-wing [[Croatian Democratic Union|HDZ]] government, inhibiting its relations with the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]]. In 1997 United States diplomacy even called upon its European partners to suspend Croatia from the [[Council of Europe]] as long as country fails to show adequate respect for human and minority rights.<ref name=\"USA-Podunavlje\">{{cite journal|url= http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=68736 |title=Sjedinjene Američke Države i reintegracija hrvatskog Podunavlja|journal=Scrinia Slavonica|volume=8|issue=1|author= Albert Bing| publisher= Scrinia Slavonica, Vol.8, Croatian Institute of History|format=PDF |pages= 336–365|date= April 2016|access-date=2016-09-12}}</ref> Lack of improvement in these areas severely hindered the advance of Croatia's prospects for further Euro-Atlantic integration. Progress in the areas of Dayton, Erdut, and refugee returns were evident in 1998, but progress was slow and required intensive international engagement. Croatia's unsatisfactory performance implementing broader democratic reforms in 1998 raised questions about the ruling party's commitment to basic democratic principles and norms. Areas of concern included restrictions on freedom of speech, one-party control of public TV and radio, repression of independent media, unfair electoral regulations, a judiciary that is not fully independent, and lack of human and civil rights protection.\n\nWith the 1999 death of President [[Franjo Tuđman]], [[2000 Croatian parliamentary election]] as well as corresponding regional changes such as the [[Overthrow of Slobodan Milošević]], the [[European Union]] organized the 2000 Zagreb and 2003 [[Thessaloniki]] Summits in which European integration perspective was discussed for all the countries in the region.<ref name=\"WBSummit\">{{cite web |url=https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2018-12/20160713-01.final-declaration-by-the-chair-of-the-paris-western-balkans-summit.pdf|title=Final Declaration by the Chair of the Paris Western Balkans Summit (4 July 2016)|access-date=25 July 2016 |author=[[2016 Western Balkans Summit, Paris]]}}</ref> The new [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|SDP]]-led [[centre-left]] [[coalition government]] slowly relinquished control over public media companies and did not interfere with freedom of speech and independent media, though it did not complete the process of making [[Croatian Radiotelevision]] independent. Judiciary reforms remained a pending issue as well. The government's foreign relations were severely affected by the hesitance and stalling of the extradition of Croatian general [[Janko Bobetko]] to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY), and inability to take general [[Ante Gotovina]] into custody for questioning by the Court. Nevertheless, Croatia managed to enter NATO's [[Partnership for Peace]] Programme in May 2000, [[World Trade Organization]] in July 2000, signing a [[European Union Association Agreement|Stabilization and Association Agreement]] with the EU in October 2001, [[Membership Action Plan]] in May 2002, and joined the [[Central European Free Trade Agreement]] (CEFTA) in December 2002. The EU membership application was the last major international undertaking of the [[Cabinet of Ivica Račan II|Račan government]], which submitted a 7,000-page report in reply to the questionnaire by the [[European Commission]]. Negotiations were initiated with the achievement of the full cooperation with the [[ICTY|Hague Tribunal]] in October 2005. Croatian president [[Stjepan Mesić]] participated in the NAM conferences in [[Havana]] in 2006 and [[Sharm el-Sheikh]] in 2009 using the country's post-Yugoslav link with the [[Third World]] in its successful campaign for the Eastern European Spot at the [[United Nations Security Council]] in 2008–2009 (in open competition with [[Czech Republic]] which was a member state both of EU and NATO).<ref name=\"UNSC-NAM\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dw.com/hr/hrvatska-izabrana-u-vije%C4%87e-sigurnosti-un-a-kao-nestalna-%C4%8Dlanica/a-2828233 |title=Hrvatska izabrana u Vijeće sigurnosti UN-a kao nestalna članica |last=Avdović |first=Erol |date=17 October 2007 |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |access-date=31 March 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"Mesić-NAM\">{{cite web |url=https://slobodnadalmacija.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/nesvrstanima-hrvatski-zbogom-nakon-ulaska-u-eu-91105 |title=Nesvrstanima hrvatski zbogom nakon ulaska u EU |date=7 March 2010 |publisher=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]] |access-date=31 March 2020 }}</ref>\n\nRefugee returns accelerated since 1999, reached a peak in 2000, but then slightly decreased in 2001 and 2002.

The new [[Cabinet of Ivo Sanader I|Sanader government]] elected in [[2003 Croatian parliamentary election|2003 elections]] repeated the assurances that Croatia will fulfill the missing political obligations, and expedited the extradition of several ICTY inductees. The [[European Commission]] replied to the answers of the questionnaire sent to Croatia on 20 April 2004 with a positive opinion. The country was finally accepted as EU candidate in July 2004. Italy and United Kingdom ratified the Stabilization and Association Agreement shortly thereafter, while the ten EU member states that were admitted to membership that year ratified it all together at a 2004 European Summit. In December 2004, the EU leaders announced that accession negotiations with Croatia would start on 17 March 2005 provided that Croatian government cooperates fully with the ICTY. The main issue, the flight of general [[Ante Gotovina|Gotovina]], however, remained unsolved and despite the agreement on an accession negotiation framework, the negotiations did not begin in March 2005. On 4 October 2005 Croatia finally received green light for accession negotiations after the Chief Prosecutor of the ICTY [[Carla Del Ponte]] officially stated that Croatia is fully cooperating with the Tribunal. This has been the main condition demanded by EU foreign ministers for accession negotiations. The ICTY called upon other southern European states to follow Croatia's good example. Thanks to the consistent position of [[Austria]] during the meeting of EU foreign ministers, a long period of instability and the questioning of the determination of the Croatian government to extradite alleged war criminals has ended successfully. Croatian Prime minister [[Ivo Sanader]] declared that full cooperation with the Hague Tribunal will continue. The accession process was also complicated by the insistence of [[Slovenia]], an EU member state, that the [[Croatia–Slovenia border disputes|two countries' border issues]] be dealt with prior to Croatia's accession to the EU.\n\nCroatia finished accession negotiations on 30 June 2011, and on 9 December 2011, signed the [[Treaty of Accession 2011|Treaty of Accession]].<ref name=\"close4prop\">[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/11/397 Statement by President Barroso on Croatia – Commission proposes to close the last \"Chapters\" in the accession talks] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927052308/http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO%2F11%2F397 |date=27 September 2012 }} European Commission, 10 June 2011</ref> A [[2012 Croatian European Union membership referendum|referendum on EU accession]] was held in Croatia on 22 January 2012, with 66% of participants voting in favour of joining the Union.<ref name=\"Dw-world.de\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,6702424,00.html |title=Croats say 'yes' to EU membership &#124; Europe &#124; DW.DE &#124; 22.01.2012 |publisher=Dw-world.de |access-date=3 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127094022/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,6702424,00.html |archive-date=27 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"referendum1\">{{cite web |author=Independent Newspapers Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/world/croatia-sets-date-for-eu-referendum-1.1204088 |title=Croatia sets date for EU referendum |publisher=Iol.co.za |date=23 December 2011 |access-date=3 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114164109/http://www.iol.co.za/news/world/croatia-sets-date-for-eu-referendum-1.1204088 |archive-date=14 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"referendum2\">{{cite web |url=http://focus-fen.net/?id=n267023 |title=Croatian parliament calls EU referendum for January 22 |publisher=Focus-fen.net |access-date=3 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426004942/http://focus-fen.net/?id=n267023 |archive-date=26 April 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"referendum3\">{{cite web |url=http://daily.tportal.hr/166910/Parl-t-decides-that-EU-referendum-will-be-held-on-22-January.html |title=Parl't decides that EU referendum will be held on 22 January |publisher=Daily.tportal.hr |access-date=3 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524163945/http://daily.tportal.hr/166910/Parl-t-decides-that-EU-referendum-will-be-held-on-22-January.html |archive-date=24 May 2013 }}</ref> The ratification process was concluded on 21 June 2013, and entry into force and accession of Croatia to the EU took place on 1 July 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eu2011.hu/news/eu-summit-accession-treaty-croatia-be-signed-2011 |title=EU Summit: Accession Treaty with Croatia to be signed in 2011 |date=27 June 2011 |publisher=eu2011.hu |access-date=30 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630191705/http://www.eu2011.hu/news/eu-summit-accession-treaty-croatia-be-signed-2011 |archive-date=30 June 2011 }}</ref> The Council of Europe was led by Croatian diplomat [[Marija Pejčinović Burić]] from 2019 to 2024.\n\n==Foreign affairs==\nThe main objective of modern Croatian foreign policy is leadership positioning within European international institutions and throughout Southeast Europe, cooperation with NATO partners and strengthening multilateral and bilateral cooperation.<ref>{{cite web |title=MVEP • Vanjska politika |url=http://www.mvep.hr/hr/vanjska-politika |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427233256/http://www.mvep.hr/hr/vanjska-politika/ |archive-date=27 April 2016 |access-date=30 April 2016 |publisher=Mvep.hr}}</ref>\n\nGovernment officials in charge of foreign policy include the [[Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs (Croatia)|Minister of Foreign and European Affairs]], currently [[Gordan Grlić-Radman]], and the [[President of Croatia|President of the Republic]], currently [[Zoran Milanović]].\n\nCroatia has established diplomatic relations with [[List of diplomatic relations of Croatia|189 countries around the world]].

More than half of that money was used to fund programs encouraging sustainable returns of refugees and displaced persons. About one-third of the assistance was used for democratization efforts, and another 5% funded financial sector restructuring.\n\nIn 2003 USAID considered Croatia to be on a \"glide path for graduation\" along with [[Bulgaria]]. Its funding from 2002 and 20024 included around $10&nbsp;million for economic development, up to $5&nbsp;million for the development of democratic institutions, about $5&nbsp;million for the return of population affected by war and between 2 and 3&nbsp;million dollars for the \"mitigation of adverse social conditions and trends\". A rising amount of funding is given to cross-cutting programs in anti-[[political corruption|corruption]], slightly under one million dollars.\n\nThe European Commission has proposed to assist Croatia's efforts to join the European Union with 245&nbsp;million euros from [[PHARE]], [[Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession|ISPA]] and [[SAPARD]] aid programs over the course of 2005 and 2006.\n\n==International disputes==\nRelations with neighbouring states have normalized somewhat since the breakup of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Work has begun — bilaterally and within the [[Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe]] since 1999 — on political and economic cooperation in the region.\n\n===Bosnia and Herzegovina===\n{{main|Bosnia and Herzegovina–Croatia relations}}\n[[File:Генерални конзулат Републике Хрватске у Бањалуци.jpg|thumb|Consulate-General in [[Banja Luka]], 2011|239x239px]]\nDiscussions continue between Croatia and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on various sections of the border, the longest border with another country for each of these countries. Sections of the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] river and villages at the base of Mount [[Plješevica]] are in Croatia, while some are in Bosnia, which causes an excessive number of border crossings on a single route and impedes any serious development in the region. The [[Zagreb]]-[[Bihać]]-[[Split (city)|Split]] railway line is still closed for major traffic due to this issue. The border on the Una river between [[Hrvatska Kostajnica]] on the northern, Croatian side of the river, and [[Kostajnica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanska Kostajnica]] on the southern, Bosnian side, is also being discussed. A river island between the two towns is under Croatian control, but is also claimed by Bosnia. A shared border crossing point has been built and has been functioning since 2003, and is used without hindrance by either party.\n\nThe Herzegovinian municipality of [[Neum]] in the south makes the southernmost part of Croatia an exclave and the two countries are negotiating special transit rules through Neum to compensate for that. Recently Croatia has opted to build a [[Pelješac bridge|bridge to the Pelješac peninsula]] to connect the Croatian mainland with the exclave but Bosnia and Herzegovina has protested that the bridge will close its access to [[international waters]] (although Croatian territory and territorial waters surround Bosnian-Herzegovinian territory and waters completely) and has suggested that the bridge must be higher than 55 meters for free passage of all types of ships. Negotiations are still being held.\n\n===Montenegro===\n{{main|Croatia–Montenegro relations}}\nCroatia and Montenegro have a largely latent border dispute over the [[Prevlaka]] peninsula, and maintain friendly relations.\n\n===Serbia===\n{{main|Croatia–Serbia relations|Croatia–Serbia border dispute}}\nThe border between [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]] in the area of the [[Danube]] is [[territorial dispute|disputed]] while at the same time the issue is not considered of the highest priority for either country in their bilateral relations.<ref name=\"Balkan Insight\">{{Cite web |url=https://balkaninsight.com/2017/07/03/border-disputes-still-bedevil-most-ex-yugoslav-states-07-01-2017-1/ |title=Border Disputes Still Bedevil Ex-Yugoslav States |author1=Sven Milekic |author2=Maja Zivanovic |publisher=[[Balkan Insight]] |language= |date=3 July 2017 |access-date=24 May 2023}}</ref> The issue therefore only occasionally entered into in the public debate with other open issues being higher on the agenda, yet with some commentators fearing that the issue may once be used as an asymmetric pressure tool in the [[accession of Serbia to the European Union]].<ref name=\"Bickl\">{{cite journal |last=Bickl |first=Thomas |date=2022 |title=Meandering Limits: The Danube Border Dispute Between Croatia and Serbia and Ways to Its Resolution |journal=[[Croatian Political Science Review]] |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=112–140 |doi=10.20901/pm.59.2.05 |s2cid=252240169 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name=\"France24\"/> While Serbia holds the opinion that the [[thalweg]] of the Danube valley and the centerline of the river represents the international border between the two countries, Croatia disagrees and claims that the international border lies along the boundaries of the [[cadastre|cadastral municipalities]] located along the river—departing from the course at several points along a {{convert|140|km|adj=on}} section.<ref name=\"France24\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20211029-serbia-croatia-river-row-leaves-residents-high-and-dry |title=Serbia, Croatia river row leaves residents high and dry |author=n.a. |publisher=[[France 24]] |language= |date=29 October 2021 |access-date=24 May 2023}}</ref> The cadastre-based boundary reflects the course of the Danube which existed in the 19th century, before [[meander]]ing and [[hydrotechnical|hydrotechnical engineering]] works altered its course.

The two states contested the sovereign ownership of Yugoslav bank [[Ljubljanska banka]], which ended in Slovenia's favor. The status of Croatian depositors' savings in the bank remains an outstanding issue. Slovenia was disputing Croatia's claim to establish the [[Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone]], an economic section of the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]].\n\n== Diplomatic relations ==\nList of
