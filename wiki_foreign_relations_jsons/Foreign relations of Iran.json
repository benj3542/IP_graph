In a series of international polls by [[Pew Research]] in 2012, only one country (Pakistan) had the majority of its population supporting Iran's right to acquire nuclear arms; every other population polled overwhelmingly rejected a nuclear-armed Iran (90–95% opposed in the polled European, North American, and South American countries), and majorities in most of them were in favor of military action to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran from materializing. Additionally, the majority of Americans, Brazilians, Japanese, Mexicans, Egyptians, Germans, Britons, French, Italians, Spaniards, and Poles (among other national groups) had majority support for \"tougher sanctions\" on Iran, while majorities in [[China]], [[Russia]], and [[Turkey]] opposed tougher sanctions.<ref>[https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2012/05/18/a-global-no-to-a-nuclear-armed-iran/ \"A Global “No” To a Nuclear-Armed Iran\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191026164420/https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2012/05/18/a-global-no-to-a-nuclear-armed-iran/ |date=26 October 2019}}.

This suspicion manifests itself in attitudes that many foreigners might find incomprehensible, such as the \"fairly common\" belief that the [[Iranian Revolution]] was actually the work of a conspiracy between Iran's [[Shi'a]] clergy and the British government.<ref>Movali, Ifshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', Norton, 2005</ref> This may have been a result of the anti-Shah bias in [[BBC World Service|BBC Radio's]] influential Persian broadcasts into Iran: a BBC report of 23 March 2009 explains that many in Iran saw the broadcaster and the government as one, and interpreted the bias for [[Khomeini]] as evidence of weakening British government support for the Shah. It is entirely plausible that the BBC did indeed help hasten revolutionary events.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7958000/7958882.stm|title=Was BBC biased against the Shah of Iran?|work=BBC News|date=23 March 2009|access-date=17 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330062156/http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7958000/7958882.stm|archive-date=30 March 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Significant historical treaties===\n* [[Treaty of Zuhab]] by which Iran irrevocably lost [[Mesopotamia]] (Iraq) to the Ottomans.

In Khomeini's own words:\n\n<blockquote>We shall [[export of revolution|export our revolution]] to the whole world. Until the cry [[Shahada|\"There is no God but Allah\"]] resounds over the whole world, there will be struggle.<ref>[11 February 1979 (according to Dilip Hiro in ''The Longest War'' p.32) p.108 from ''Excerpts from Speeches and Messages of Imam Khomeini on the Unity of the Muslims''.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Islamic Republic's effort to spread the revolution is considered to have begun in earnest in March 1982, when 380 men from more than 25 Arab and Islamic nations met at the former Tehran Hilton Hotel for a \"seminar\" on the \"ideal Islamic government\" and, less academically, the launch of a large-scale offensive to cleanse the Islamic world of the satanic Western and Communist influences that were seen to be hindering the Islamic world's progress. The gathering of militants, primarily Shi'a but including some [[Sunni]]s, \"with various religious and revolutionary credentials\", was hosted by the Association of Militant Clerics and the Pasdaran Islamic Revolutionary Guards.<ref>Wright, Robin, ''Sacred Rage'' (2001), p.28</ref> The nerve centre of the revolutionary crusade, operational since shortly after the 1979 revolution, was located in downtown Tehran and known to outsiders as the \"Taleghani Centre\". Here the groundwork for the gathering was prepared: the establishment of Arab cadres, recruited or imported from surrounding countries to spread the revolution, and provision of headquarters for such groups as the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, the Iraqi Shi'a movement, and Philippine Moro, Kuwaiti, Saudi, North African and Lebanese militant clerics.\n\nThese groups came under the umbrella of the \"Council for the Islamic Revolution\", which was supervised by Ayatollah [[Hussein Ali Montazeri]], the designated heir of Ayatollah Khomeini. Most of the council's members were clerics, but they also reportedly included advisors from the Syrian and Libyan intelligence agencies. The council apparently received more than $1&nbsp;billion annually in contributions from the faithful in other countries and in funds allocated by the Iranian government.<ref>Wright, Robin, ''Sacred Rage'', (2001), p. 33</ref>\n\nIts strategy was two-pronged: armed struggle against what were perceived as Western imperialism and its agents; and an internal purifying process to free Islamic territory and Muslim minds of non-Islamic cultural, intellectual and spiritual influences, by providing justice, services, resources to the ''mustazafin'' (weak) masses of the Muslim world. These attempts to spread its Islamic revolution strained the country's relations with many of its Arab neighbours, and the extrajudicial execution of Iranian dissidents in Europe unnerved European nations, particularly France and Germany. For example, the Islamic Republic expressed its opinion of Egypt's secular government by naming a street in Tehran after Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's killer, Khalid al-Istanbuli.<ref>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p. 143</ref> At this time Iran found itself very isolated, but this was a secondary consideration to the spread of revolutionary ideals across the [[Persian Gulf]] and confrontation with the US (or \"Great Satan\") in the 1979-1981 [[Iran hostage crisis|hostage crisis]].\n\n===Revolutionary influence and regional interventions===\nArab and other Muslim volunteers who came to Iran were trained in camps run by the Revolutionary Guards. There were three primary bases in Tehran, and others in [[Ahvaz]], [[Isfahan]], [[Qom]], [[Shiraz]], and [[Mashhad]], and a further facility, converted in 1984, near the southern naval base at Bushire.<ref>Wright, Robin, ''Sacred Rage'', (2001), pp. 34-5</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Iran supported an [[1981 Bahraini coup d'état attempt|attempt]] to overthrow the [[Bahrain]]i government, in 1983 expressed political support for Shi'ites who bombed Western embassies in [[Kuwait]], and in 1987 Iranian pilgrims rioted at poor living conditions and treatment during the [[Hajj]] (pilgrimage) in [[Mecca]], Saudi Arabia, and were consequently massacred. Nations with strong fundamentalist movements, such as [[Egypt]] and [[Algeria]], also began to mistrust Iran. With the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Iran was thought to be supporting the creation of the [[Hizballah]] organization. Furthermore, Iran went on to oppose the Arab–Israeli peace process, because it saw Israel as an illegal country.\n\n===Iran–Iraq War===\n{{See also|Iran–Iraq relations| Iran–Iraq War}}\nIranian relations with [[Iraq]] have never been good. They took a turn for the worse in 1980 when Iraq invaded Iran. The stated reason for Iraq's invasion was the contested sovereignty over the [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway (''Arvand Rud'' in Persian). Other unstated reasons were probably more significant: Iran and Iraq had a history of interference in each other's affairs by supporting separatist movements, although this interference had ceased since the [[Algiers Agreement (1975)|Algiers Agreement]].\n\nIran demanded the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Iranian territory and the return to the ''status quo ante'' for the Shatt al-Arab, as established under the Algiers Agreement. This period saw Iran become even more isolated, with virtually no allies. Exhausted by the war, Iran signed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 598|UN Security Council Resolution 598]] in July 1988, after the United States and Germany began supplying [[Iraq]] with [[chemical weapon]]s. The ceasefire resulting from the UN resolution was implemented on 20 August 1988. Neither nation had made any real gains in the war, which left one million dead and had a dramatic effect on the country's foreign policy. From this point on, the Islamic Republic recognized that it had no choice but to moderate its radical approach and rationalize its objectives. This was the beginning of what Anoushiravan Ehteshami calls the \"reorientation phase\" of Iranian foreign policy.\n\n===Pragmatism===\nLike other revolutionary states, practical considerations have sometimes led the Islamic Republic to inconsistency and subordination of such ideological concerns as pan-Islamic solidarity. One observer, Graham Fuller, has called the Islamic Republic \"stunningly silent\"\n<blockquote>about [Muslim] [[First Chechen War|Chechens]] in [non-Muslim] [[Russia]], or [[East Turkestan independence movement|Uyghurs]] in China,<ref>See [http://www.uhrp.org/ Uyghurs Human Rights Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914044544/http://www.uhrp.org/ |date=14 September 2007}}</ref> simply because the Iranian state has important strategic ties with both China and Russia that need to be preserved in the state interest. Iran has astonishingly even supported Christian [[Armenia]] in the [[First Nagorno-Karabakh War]] against Shi'ite [[Azerbaijan]] and has been careful not to lend too much support to Islamic Tajiks in [[Tajikistan]], where the language is basically a dialect of Persian.</blockquote>\n\n==Khamenei's leadership==\n===Post-war foreign policy and regional influence===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2023}}\n[[File:Flickr - World Economic Forum - Mohammad Khatami - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2004.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Mohammad Khatami|Khatami]] (in office: 1997–2005) played a key role in repairing Iran's foreign relations with Europe.]]\nSince the end of the Iran–Iraq War, Iran's new foreign policy has had a dramatic effect on its global standing. Relations with the [[European Union]] have dramatically improved, to the point where Iran is a major oil exporter and a trading partner with such countries as [[Italy]], France, and Germany. [[China]] and [[Pakistan]] have also emerged as friends of Iran; these three countries face similar challenges in the global economy as they industrialize, and consequently find themselves aligned on a number of issues.\n\nIran maintains regular diplomatic and commercial relations with [[Russia]] and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|former Soviet Republics]]. Both Iran and Russia believe they have important national interests at stake in developments in Central Asia and the Transcaucasus, particularly concerning energy resources from the Caspian Sea. The Islamic Republic of Iran accords priority to its relations with the other states in the region and with the rest of the Islamic world. This includes a strong commitment to the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Relations with the states of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC), especially with [[Saudi Arabia]], are characterized by rivalry and hostility. An unresolved territorial dispute with the [[United Arab Emirates]] concerning three islands in the Persian Gulf continues to mar its relations with these states. Iran has close [[Iran–Kuwait relations|relations with Kuwait]].\n\n===Isolation, sanctions, and global ambitions===\n[[File:Swedish PM Stefan Löfven meeting Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei 04.jpg|thumb|[[Ali Khamenei]] with Swedish Prime Minister [[Stefan Löfven]], 11 February 2017]]\nIran seeks new allies around the world due to its increasing political and economic isolation in the international community.<ref>Fredrik Dahl, [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-revolution-cleric-idUSTRE5833FV20090904 \"Iran cleric says ''time to export the revolution''\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016110628/http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/04/us-iran-revolution-cleric-idUSTRE5833FV20090904 |date=16 October 2015}}, \"Reuters\", 4 September 2009</ref><ref>[http://bigthink.com/ideas/41772 \"Iran Seeks Allies in South America\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120710083109/http://bigthink.com/ideas/41772 |date=10 July 2012}}, 2 January 2012</ref> This isolation is evident in the various economic sanctions and the EU oil embargo that have been implemented in response to questions that have been raised over the [[Iranian nuclear program]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16674660 \"EU Iran sanctions: Ministers adopt Iran oil imports ban\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011231029/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16674660 |date=11 October 2018}}, \"BBC News\", 23 January 2012</ref>\n\nTehran supports the Interim Governing Council in [[Iraq]], but it strongly advocates a prompt and full transfer of state authority to the Iraqi people.

Iran is also pursuing a policy of stabilization and cooperation with the countries of the [[Caucasus]] and Central Asia, whereby it is seeking to capitalise on its central location to establish itself as the political and economic hub of the region.\n\nOn the international scene, it has been argued by some that Iran has become, or will become in the near future, a superpower due to its ability to influence international events. Others, such as [[Robert Baer]], have argued that Iran is already an [[energy superpower]] and is on its way to becoming an empire. [[Flynt Leverett]] calls Iran a rising power that might well become a nuclear power in coming years—if the US does not prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear technology, as part of a grand bargain under which Iran would cease its nuclear activities in exchange for a guarantee of its borders by the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcf.org/publications/internationalaffairs/leverett_diplomatic.pdf

After the breakup of the USSR, the newly independent republics bordering the Caspian Sea claimed shares of territorial waters and the seabed, thus unilaterally abrogating the existing half-and-half USSR-Iran agreements which, like all other Soviet treaties, the republics had agreed to respect upon their independence. It has been suggested by these countries that the Caspian Sea should be divided in proportion to each bordering country's shoreline, in which case Iran's share would be reduced to about 13%. The Iranian side has expressed eagerness to know if this means that all Irano–Russian and –Soviet agreements are void, entitling Iran to claim territorial sovereignty over lands lost to Russia by treaties that the parties still consider ''vivant''. Issues between [[Russia]], Kazakhstan, and [[Azerbaijan]] were settled in 2003, but Iran does not recognize these agreements, on the premise that the international law governing open water can not be applied to the Caspian Sea, which is in fact a lake (a landlocked body of water).

The nearly 30,000 tonne tanker and its 23 crew members were surrounded by 4 vessels and 1 helicopter. Many think this was in retaliation of the UK boarding an Iranian Supertanker, the Grace 1, at Gibraltar earlier in July due to suspicions of smuggling oil to Syria. As of today, the tanker has been moved to the port of Bander Abbas and the ship's owners have not been able to contact the tanker. The British Foreign Minister [[Jeremy Hunt]] has said that Iran will suffer serious consequences if the tanker is not released. The British diplomatic effort is being supported by American President [[Donald Trump]] and both French and German foreign ministries. UK ships are urged to stay away from the strait and the result of this is an increase in oil prices around the world.\n|}\n\n===Oceania===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal relations began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{Flag|Australia}}||21 September 1968.
