To a large extent, the two succeeding presidents, [[Abdou Diouf]] and [[Abdoulaye Wade]], have carried on Senghor's policies and philosophies. [[Senegal]] has long supported functional integration among [[French West Africa|French-speaking West African states]] through the [[West African Economic and Monetary Union]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Foreign Policy of Senegal Since 2000 |url=https://saiia.org.za/research/the-foreign-policy-of-senegal-since-2000/ |access-date=2022-05-05 |website=SAIIA |language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nSenegal has a high profile in many [[international organization]]s and was a member of the [[UN Security Council]] in 1988–89. It was elected to the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]] in 1997. Friendly to the West, especially to France and to the United States, Senegal also is a vigorous proponent of more [[Aid|assistance]] from developed countries to the [[Third World]]. Additionally, Senegal has been a member state of the [[African Union]] since 1963.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Member States {{!}} African Union |url=https://au.int/en/member_states/countryprofiles2 |access-date=2022-05-05 |website=au.int |archive-date=September 1, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220901043534/https://au.int/en/member_states/countryprofiles2 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSenegal borders [[The Gambia]], [[Mauritania]], [[Mali]], [[Guinea]], and [[Guinea-Bissau]]. Senegal enjoys mostly cordial relations with its neighbors. In spite of clear progress on other fronts with [[Mauritania]] (border security, resource management, economic integration, etc.), there remains the problem of an estimated 30,000 Black Mauritanian [[refugee]]s living in Senegal.\n\nSenegal is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a [[Bilateral Immunity Agreement]] of protection for the US-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).\n\n== Pre-colonial foreign policy ==\nSenegal was regarded as Senegambia before the arrival of Europeans (Jaiteh),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~msj42/Senegambia.htm|title=Senegambia|last=Malanding|first=Jaiteh J.|date=16 December 2008|website=The Atlas of the Gambia|access-date=1 October 2019}}</ref> where a number of independent kingdoms settled.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, the African slave trade took advantage of autonomous kingdoms such as, the Wolof and Jolof kingdoms (Tang, 3).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Masters of the Sabar: Wolof Griot Percussionists of Senegal|last=Tang|first=Patricia|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2007|location=Philadelphia|page=3}}</ref> The establishment of French colonies coupled with the competing hegemonic power between local ethnic groups within the Wolof kingdom led to a power void after traditional rulers could not prevent the French from impeding the establishments already in place by politicians and elites (Venema, 4) . The change from slave trade to the trade of cash crops set the precedent for the collapse of states within both empires (Gray, 3).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite thesis |degree=PhD |title=The Groundnut Market in Senegal: Examination of Price and Policy Changes |publisher=Virginia Tech |last=Gray|first=James K.|s2cid=157599763|date=10 June 2002 |hdl=10919/28143 |hdl-access=free}}</ref> The French used Senegal's advantageous geographic location, on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, to safeguard their interest in the trade of groundnuts (Schraeder and Gaye, 488).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |last=Schraeder |first=Peter J. |others=Nefertiti Gaye |date=1997 |title=Senegal's Foreign Policy: Challenges of Democratization and Marginalization |journal=African Affairs |volume=96 |issue=385 |pages=485–508 |jstor=723816 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a007881}}</ref> The foreign policy of Senegal is also characterized by the religious values and beliefs of Islam. The spiritual traditions and foundations of Senegal represent another facet of foreign policy in and outside of the region. Political and diplomatic actors are ultimately determined by marabouts that intercede on behalf of the people to Allah (Schraeder and Gaye, 489).<ref name=\":0\" /> Some marabouts establish loyalist relationships of patron with political leaders. Marabouts do not make policy, but their support is essential to the stability of government (Behrman Creevey, 262).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Behrman|first=Lucy Creevey|date=1977|title=Muslim Politics and Development in Senegal: The Journal of Modern African Studies|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=261–277 |jstor=159921 |doi=10.1017/S0022278X00053933 |s2cid=154501016}}</ref>\n\n== Independence (1960-1989) ==\nSenegalese independence began in 1960 with [[Léopold Sédar Senghor|Léopold Sedar Sénghor]] as the first president and was succeeded by [[Abdou Diouf]] in 1980. Senegalese diplomats in the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] believe that West Africa must unite in order to not only remain competitive in an international economy dominated by superpowers like China and the United States, but also promote and consolidate economic development within West Africa.<ref name=\":0\" /> Senegalese policy officials prioritize and use the individual strengths of surrounding African countries in order to strengthen regional economies and weaken regional dependency on foreign actors. This combative approach for western influence is underscored in the Senegalese constitution in clause four of the preamble: \"must spare no effort in the fulfillment of African Unity\".<ref name=\":0\" /> These efforts have been actively pursued through formal diplomatic agreements with neighboring countries, such as the Mali Foundation in 1960, the Federation with Gambia from 1982 to 1989, as well as informal forms of cooperation such as the Inter-State Authority in the Fight Against Drought in the Sahel (CILSS), The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), The Joint African and Malagasy Organization (OCAM), the Organization for the Development of the Gambia River Valley (OMVG), and the Organization for the Development of the Senegal River Valley (OMVS).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Cold War Foreign Policy ===\nDuring the [[Cold War]], Senegal was part of the non-aligned world and remained neutral throughout the conflict. In 1965, the first Foreign Minister of Senegal, [[Doudou Thiam]], published a book titled \"The Foreign Policy of African States.\"<ref name=\":022\">{{Cite book |last=Thiam |first=Doudou |title=The Foreign Policy of African States: Ideological Bases, Present Realities, and Future Prospects |publisher=Praeger |year=1965 |isbn=978-0-8371-8555-2 |location=New York}}</ref> Thiam implored Africa to move beyond the ideological divisions of the Cold War to form a third neutral ideology on which African states could build their own path.<ref name=\":022\" /> This concept of non-alignment became a central theme in Senegalese politics.

Nonetheless, Senegal's ties with Western countries like France tilted its alignment westward.\n\n==== \"La Francophonie\" ====\nOne of the important strategic goals of Senegalese leaders was the integration and cooperation of Francophone Africa; a policy known as \"la Francophonie\" coined by President Senghor.<ref name=\":0\" /> The promotion of this concept played a key role in the formation of worldwide summits, such as the Franco-African Summit, that allowed Senegal to emerge as a leader within the [[francophone]] movement in Africa, African consolidation, unification and cooperation are at the center of Senegalese foreign policy.<ref name=\":0\" /> Senegal was also one of the founding members of several organizations designed to integrate Francophone Africa, including the African and Malagasy Common Organization in 1961 and the Malian Federation in 1960.<ref name=\":422\">{{Cite web |last=Walters |first=Kurt Cornelis Frederik |date=June 1966 |title=The Mali Federation: A Case Study for Political Integration |url=https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1794/5886/Mali_federation.pdf;sequence=1 |access-date=April 27, 2022}}</ref><ref name=\":3222\">{{Citation |last1=Vinokurov |first1=Evgeny |title=Dissolution of Regional Organizations |date=2017 |work=Re-Evaluating Regional Organizations |pages=211–222 |place=Cham |publisher=Springer International Publishing |isbn=978-3-319-53054-3 |last2=Libman |first2=Alexander|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-53055-0_13 }}</ref>\n\n==== \"Négritude\" ====\nAnother cornerstone of Senegalese foreign policy during the Cold War was the exemplification of African Art and international cultural ties. This was connected to President Senghor's ideology of \"Negritude\" which emphasized Pan-Africanism and the exceptionalism of African culture.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1966, the [[First World Festival of Negro Arts]] was hosted in Dakar, Senegal.<ref name=\":112\">{{Cite thesis |last=Taylor |first=Lauren Elizabeth |date=2019 |title=The Art of Diplomacy in Dakar: The International Politics of Display at the 1966 Premier Festival Mondial des Arts Negroes. |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1x92f92j |journal=UCLA}}</ref> The event was a tribute the art and excellence of the African Diaspora across the world.

At the same time, the First World Festival of Negro Arts was seen by many post-colonial states as neocolonial due to its connection to French concept of Negritude and cooperation with Western powers.<ref name=\":112\" /> The event strained relationships with Algeria and Guinea who would host their own festival in the years following in Algiers.<ref name=\":112\" />\n\n==== Iran-Senegal Relations ====\nSenegal's non-alignment policy also contributed to the building of significant relationships with other nations. President Sénghor developed strong political and economic ties with the Shah of Iran, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]. In 1971, formal diplomatic relations were established, and, by 1973, the Shah was providing $2.4 million in developmental loans for Senegal (Steele 180–1).<ref name=\":15\" /> Iran continued to provide development investment and loans from 1974 to 1979 that focused on the trade of Iranian oil for Senegalese phosphate, including the creation of an oil refinery and a new adjacent city in Senegal (Steele 183–4).<ref name=\":15\" /> The project was never completed due to funding gaps and the [[Iranian Revolution]], despite strong intentions to move forward.\n\n== Current Partnerships ==\n\n=== U.S.-Senegal Relations ===\nDiplomatic relations between the [[United States]] and Senegal began in 1960, following independence and the dissolution of the Mali Federation.<ref name=\":132\">{{Cite web |title=The United States and Senegal: 60 Years of Partnership |url=https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-and-senegal-60-years-of-partnership/ |access-date=2022-05-12 |website=United States Department of State |language=en}}</ref> Early after independence, a relationship was formed between President Senghor and U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] as part of the latter's \"African Policy.\"<ref name=\":1222\"/> As part of Senegal's policy of non-alignment and African Socialism, bilateral relations between the two were limited but meaningful. The United States contributed aid to Senegal, including for the First World Festival of Negro Arts, and maintained consistent contact with the country throughout the Cold War via its [[United States Agency for International Development|US Agency for International Development]] (USAID).<ref name=\":1222\"/>\n\nToday, [[Senegal–United States relations|U.S.-Senegal Relations]] are defined by foreign aid, military cooperation, and the protection of democracy in the region. The United States provides a growing amount of economic aid to the country. Senegal has received aid for democracy promotion, food security, and development projects like $1.5 million in aid for solar energy and nano-loan financing systems.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-03-31 |title=U.S. Government supports access to energy and finance through new grants operating in Africa including Senegal {{!}} Press Release {{!}} Senegal |url=https://www.usaid.gov/senegal/press-releases/mar-30-2022-us-government-supports-access-energy-and-finance-through-new |access-date=2022-05-12 |website=[[USAID]] |language=en |archive-date=May 12, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220512211805/https://www.usaid.gov/senegal/press-releases/mar-30-2022-us-government-supports-access-energy-and-finance-through-new }}</ref> Health diplomacy is another sector of aid that the United States and Senegal collaborate on.
