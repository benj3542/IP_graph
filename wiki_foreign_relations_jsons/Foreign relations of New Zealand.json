"{{Short description|none}}\n{{Politics of New Zealand|expanded=Foreign}}\n{{Use New Zealand English|date=February 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2020}}\n\nThe '''foreign relations of New Zealand''' are oriented chiefly toward developed democratic nations and emerging [[Pacific Island]] economies. Until the late 20th century, New Zealand aligned itself strongly with the [[United Kingdom]] (as a former British colony) and had few bilateral relationships with other countries. From the later half of the 20th century, Australia has been New Zealand's most important cultural, economic and military partner. Today, the country participates in several multilateral political organisations, including [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]], the [[Pacific Community]], and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]. New Zealand has been described as an [[emerging power]];<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/113097493/caught-between-china-and-the-us-the-kiwi-place-in-a-newly-confrontational-world|title=Caught between China and the US: The Kiwi place in a newly confrontational world|website=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=7 June 2019|language=en|access-date=1 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.waikato.ac.nz/news-opinion/media/2018/new-zealands-pacific-reset-strategic-anxieties-about-rising-china|title=New Zealand's Pacific reset: strategic anxieties about rising China|date=2018-06-05|website=www.waikato.ac.nz|language=en-NZ|access-date=2019-06-16}}</ref> however, such a claim needs to be considered in the context of its medium-sized economy and limited military capability. The country's major political parties have generally agreed on the broad outlines of foreign policy, and the government has been active in promoting [[free trade]], [[nuclear disarmament]], and [[arms control]].\n\nIn summer 2013, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)|New Zealand Foreign Minister]] [[Murray McCully]] reported that:\n:All New Zealand's important relationships are in good repair....With the United States there are hopes of a major breakthrough in terms of trade relations. [[China–New Zealand relations|Sino – New Zealand relations]] are also subdued, but trade is burgeoning. Japan's decision to join the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] is a welcome change and New Zealand continues to pursue a free trade agreement with South Korea. The government is pressing ahead with plans to strengthen relations in a number of other areas, including Russia, South Asia, Latin America, the Persian Gulf and especially the South Pacific. It is also alive to the potential benefits of closer ties with countries on the African continent.<ref>Murray McCully, \"Keeping Relationships in Good Repair,\" ''New Zealand International Review'' (July 2013) 38#4 p 13</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n{{See also|History of New Zealand|Independence of New Zealand}}\n\n===British Dominion===\n\nAfter [[world war one]], New Zealand signed the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) and joined the [[League of Nations]]. Wellington trusted [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] governments in London, but not [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]. When the British Labour Party took power in 1924 and 1929, the New Zealand government felt threatened by Labour's foreign policy because of its reliance upon the [[League of Nations]]. The League was distrusted and Wellington did not expect to see the coming of a peaceful world order under League auspices. What had been the Empire's most loyal [[Dominion]] became a dissenter as it opposed efforts the first and second British Labour governments to trust the League's framework of arbitration and collective security agreements.<ref>Gerald Chaudron, \"The League of Nations and Imperial Dissent: New Zealand and the British Labour Governments, 1924–31,\" ''Journal of Imperial & Commonwealth History'' (March 2011) 39#1 pp 47–71</ref>\n\nThe governments of the [[Reform Party (New Zealand)|Reform]] and [[United Party (New Zealand)|United Parties]] between 1912 and 1935 followed a \"realistic\" foreign policy. They made national security a high priority, were sceptical of international institutions such as the League, and showed no interest on the questions of [[self-determination]], [[democracy]], and [[human rights]]. However the opposition [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] was more idealistic and proposed a liberal internationalist outlook on international affairs. From 1935 the [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|First Labour Government]] showed a limited degree of idealism in foreign policy, for example opposing the [[appeasement]] of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]].<ref>D.J.

In 1947 New Zealand ratified the 1931 [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] with the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947]], which made New Zealand fully independent of Britain.\n\nThe [[Fall of Singapore]] during World War II made New Zealand realise that she could no longer rely on Britain to defend the British Empire. New Zealand troops supported the British in the successful battle against [[Malayan Emergency|Communist insurrection in Malaysia]] and maintained an air-force fighter squadron in Singapore, and later on Cyprus, again supporting British forces. New Zealand diplomats sought an alliance with the [[United States|United States of America]], and in 1951 adhered to the [[ANZUS]] Treaty between New Zealand, Australia and the US. In return for America's guarantee of protection, New Zealand felt obliged to support America in its wars, and New Zealand committed forces to the [[New Zealand in the Korean War|Korean War]] (1950–1953) under [[United Nations Command]] auspices and to the [[New Zealand in the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]]. By the 1970s, many New Zealanders began to feel uncomfortable with their country's support for the US, particularly in Vietnam and regarding the visits of nuclear-powered and armed [[United States Armed Forces]] warships. The [[Third Labour Government of New Zealand|Third Labour government]] (1972–1975) pulled New Zealand troops out of the Vietnam War and protested against [[French nuclear testing]] in the Pacific, at one stage sending a warship to act as disapproving witness to the tests.\n\n[[Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities|Britain's entry into the European Economic Community]] in 1973 forced New Zealand into a more independent role.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/1468-0289.00057|title = Britain, Butter, and European Integration, 1957–1964|journal = The Economic History Review|volume = 50|issue = 2|pages = 327–347|year = 1997|last1 = Singleton|first1 = John|last2 = Robertson|first2 = Paul L.}}</ref> The British move restricted New Zealand's trade access to its biggest market, and it sought new trading partners in Asia, America and the Middle East. Australia and New Zealand signed the free-trade [[Closer Economic Relations]] agreement in 1983. The election of the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]] in 1984 marked a new period of independent foreign policy. [[Nuclear marine propulsion|Nuclear-powered]] and nuclear-armed ships were banned from [[Exclusive economic zone of New Zealand|New Zealand waters]], effectively removing New Zealand from the ANZUS pact. Immigration laws were liberalised, leading to a massive increase in [[Immigration to New Zealand|immigration]] from Asia. The [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|Fourth National Government]] (1990–1999) liberalised trade by removing most [[tariff]]s and [[Protectionism|import restrictions]].\n\nIn 2008, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Winston Peters]] announced what he called \"a seismic change for New Zealand's foreign service\", designed to remedy the country's \"struggling to maintain an adequate presence on the international stage\". Peters said that the Ministry would receive additional funding and increase the number of New Zealand diplomats serving abroad by 50%.<ref>\n[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0804/S00406.htm \"Seismic change for NZ's foreign service\"], Winston Peters, New Zealand government press release, 16 April 2008\n</ref> However this policy was reversed following the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 General Election]] which brought the [[John Key]]-led [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand]] to power.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n==Participation in international organisations==\n\nNew Zealand participates in the United Nations (UN); the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO); [[World Bank]]; the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF); the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD); the [[International Energy Agency]]; the [[Asian Development Bank]]; the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]; the [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community]]; the [[Colombo Plan]]; [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC); and the [[International Whaling Commission]]. New Zealand also actively participates as a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. Despite the 1985 rupture in the [[ANZUS]] military alliance, New Zealand has maintained good working relations with the [[New Zealand-United States relations|United States]] and Australia on a broad array of international issues.\n\nIn the past, New Zealand's geographic isolation and its agricultural economy's general prosperity minimised public interest in international affairs. However, growing [[International trade|global trade]] and other international economic events have made New Zealanders increasingly aware of their country's dependence on unstable overseas markets.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Zealand's reliance on trade leaves us exposed to global instability |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/transforming-business/79172347/new-zealands-reliance-on-trade-leaves-us-exposed-to-global-instability |website=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=29 April 2016 |language=en}}</ref> New Zealand governments strongly advocate [[free trade]], especially in agricultural products, and the country belongs to the Cairns group of nations in the WTO.\n\nNew Zealand's economic involvement with Asia has become increasingly important. New Zealand is a \"dialogue partner\" with the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), a member of the [[East Asia Summit]] and an active participant in [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]].\n\nAs a charter member of the [[Colombo Plan]], New Zealand has provided Asian countries with technical assistance and capital. It also contributes through the [[Asian Development Bank]] and through UN programs and is a member of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|UN Economic and Social Council]] for Asia and the Pacific.\n\n===Summary of international organisation participation===\n\n[[ABEDA]], [[ANZUS]] (U.S. suspended security obligations to NZ on 11 August 1986), [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ARF]] (dialogue partner), [[Asian Development Bank|AsDB]], [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] (dialogue partner), [[Australia Group]], [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], [[Colombo Plan|CP]], [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|EBRD]], [[Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|ESCAP]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]], [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|IBRD]], [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]], [[International Chamber of Commerce|ICC]], [[International Criminal Court|ICCt]], [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions|ICFTU]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|ICRM]], [[International Development Association|IDA]], [[International Energy Agency|IEA]], [[International Fund for Agricultural Development|IFAD]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|IFRCS]], [[International Hydrographic Organization|IHO]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]], [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]], [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]], [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]] (guest), [[Nuclear Suppliers Group|NSG]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons|OPCW]], [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|PCA]], [[Pacific Islands Forum|PIF]], [[Sparteca]], [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community|SPC]], [[United Nations|UN]], [[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|UNAMSIL]], [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UNCTAD]], [[UNESCO]], [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UNIDO]], [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]], [[UNMISET]], [[United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka|UNMOP]], [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization|UNTSO]], [[Universal Postal Union|UPU]], [[World Customs Organization|WCO]], [[World Federation of Trade Unions|WFTU]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]], [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]<ref>Source: [[CIA World Factbook]], 2003 edition [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ (external link)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510200259/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ |date=10 May 2013 }}.</ref>\n\n=== United Nations ===\n{{Main|New Zealand and the United Nations}}\n\nNew Zealand was a [[founding member of the United Nations]] in 1945, and was in the first set of rotating non-permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Hanhimäki |first=Jussi M. |title=1.
