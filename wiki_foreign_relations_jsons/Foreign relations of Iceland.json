As a fully independent state, Iceland could have joined the [[League of Nations]] in 1920, but chose not to do so for cost reasons. It negotiated with [[Denmark]] to initially carry out most of its foreign relations, while maintaining full control. Denmark appointed a diplomatic envoy (Ambassador) to Iceland in 1919 and Iceland reciprocated in 1920, opening an embassy in [[Copenhagen]]. Iceland established its own Foreign Service in April 1940<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.government.is/news/article/2020/04/09/80th-anniversary-of-the-Icelandic-Foreign-Service/|title=80th anniversary of the Icelandic Foreign Service|website=government.is|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200409154227/https://www.government.is/news/article/2020/04/09/80th-anniversary-of-the-Icelandic-Foreign-Service/|archive-date=9 April 2020|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> when Denmark became [[Occupation of Denmark|occupied]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and ties between the two countries were severed.

That year, Iceland established a separate commission – along with Norway, [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]] – for the conservation, management, and study of marine mammals. Since then, Iceland has resumed whaling for scientific purpose and has rejoined the IWC (in October 2002).

The Agreed Minute was last renegotiated in 2001. At the time, the [[U.S. Air Force]] committed itself to maintaining four to six [[interceptors]] at the [[Naval Air Station Keflavik|Keflavík]] base, supported by a helicopter rescue squad. The Air Force, in order to cut costs, announced plans to remove the four remaining jets in 2003. The removal was then delayed to address Icelandic demands for continued presence of the jets. After an unfruitful series of negotiations and two reshuffles of the Icelandic government the issue lay dormant until early 2006 when the U.S. Air Force issued an official statement that withdrawal of the aircraft was already being prepared. U.S. officials have since then argued that Iceland is in no need of a military presence.\n\nNATO allies since then conduct [[Icelandic Air Policing|air policing]] after the U.S. Air Force withdrawal.\n\n== Diplomatic relations ==\nList of countries which Iceland maintains diplomatic relations with:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |[[File:Diplomatic relations of Iceland.svg|frameless|425x425px]]\n|-\n!#\n!Country\n!Date<ref name=\"iceland\">{{Cite web |title=Establishment of Diplomatic Relations |url=https://www.government.is/ministries/ministry-for-foreign-affairs/protocol/establishment-of-diplomatic-relations/ |access-date=7 June 2024|website=[[Government of Iceland]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240226010259/https://www.government.is/ministries/ministry-for-foreign-affairs/protocol/establishment-of-diplomatic-relations/|archive-date=26 February 2024|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n|1\n|{{flag|Denmark}}\n|{{dts|1 December 1918}}\n|-\n|2\n|{{flag|United Kingdom}}\n|{{dts|8 May 1940}}\n|-\n|3\n|{{flag|Sweden}}\n|{{dts|27 July 1940}}\n|-\n|4\n|{{flag|Norway}}\n|{{dts|29 August 1940}}\n|-\n|5\n|{{flag|United States}}\n|{{dts|1 July 1941}}\n|-\n|6\n|{{flag|Russia}}\n|{{dts|4 October 1943}}\n|-\n|7\n|{{flag|Italy}}\n|{{dts|15 August 1945}}\n|-\n|8\n|{{flag|Belgium}}\n|{{dts|9 November 1945}}\n|-\n|9\n|{{flag|France}}\n|{{dts|18 November 1945}}\n|-\n|10\n|{{flag|Netherlands}}\n|{{dts|9 January 1946}}\n|-\n|11\n|{{flag|Czech Republic}}\n|{{dts|27 February 1946}}\n|-\n|12\n|{{flag|Poland}}\n|{{dts|14 November 1946}}\n|-\n|13\n|{{flag|Canada}}\n|{{dts|6 June 1947}}\n|-\n|14\n|{{flag|Switzerland}}\n|{{dts|15 July 1947}}\n|-\n|15\n|{{flag|Finland}}\n|{{dts|15 August 1947}}\n|-\n|16\n|{{flag|Portugal}}\n|{{dts|23 January 1948}}\n|-\n|17\n|{{flag|Ireland}}\n|{{dts|11 March 1948}}\n|-\n|18\n|{{flag|Iran}}\n|{{dts|15 March 1948}}\n|-\n|19\n|{{flag|Spain}}\n|{{dts|20 September 1949}}\n|-\n|20\n|{{flag|Israel}}\n|{{dts|10 August 1951}}<ref>{{Cite book |title=Israel Digest, A Bi-weekly Summary of News from Israel · Volume 2 |publisher=Israel Office of Information (New York, N.Y.) |year=1951 |pages=5}}</ref>\n|-\n|21\n|{{flag|Argentina}}\n|{{dts|21 April 1952}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Memoria|publisher=Argentina Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto|year=1952|pages=210|language=es}}</ref>\n|-\n|22\n|{{flag|Brazil}}\n|{{dts|28 April 1952}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anais da Câmara dos Deputados (12)|publisher=Brazil, Congresso Nacional.

==\nIceland's first embassy was established in Copenhagen in 1920. The second and third embassies were opened in London and Sweden in 1940. That same year, a consulate-general was installed in New York (a year later, an embassy was opened in Washington D.C.). The Icelandic foreign service grew slowly (both in terms of missions and staff) in the post-WWII period, but increased rapidly after the mid-1990s. The Icelandic foreign service is vastly smaller than those of its Nordic neighbors.<ref name=\":04\" />\n\n===Africa===\n{{Legend|Silver|No formal diplomatic relations}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n!width=\"15%\"| Country\n!width=\"12%\"| Diplomatic Relations Established\n!Notes\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Burkina Faso}}||<!--Date started-->2001||\n* Burkina Faso is represented in Iceland by its embassy in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web |url=https://www.government.is/lisalib/getfile.aspx?itemid=0eb3fa9f-6130-11e9-943a-005056bc4d74 |format=PDF |title=Diplomatic And Consular List |website=Ministry For Foreign Affairs Of Iceland, Department Of Protocol |place=Reykjavík |date=December 2018 |access-date=3 September 2019 |archive-date=28 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210728042250/https://www.government.is/lisalib/getfile.aspx?itemid=0eb3fa9f-6130-11e9-943a-005056bc4d74 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|-\n|{{Flag|Kenya}}\n|<!--Date started-->2001\n|\n* Kenya is represented in Iceland by its embassy in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]]\n|-\n|{{Flag|Malawi}}\n|<!--Date started-->1989\n|\n* Iceland has an embassy in [[Lilongwe]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Embassy Information |url=https://www.government.is/diplomatic-missions/embassy-of-iceland-in-lilongwe/embassy-information/ |access-date=2025-04-24 |website=www.government.is |language=en-US}}</ref>\n* Iceland is represented in Malawi through its [[List of diplomatic missions in London|High Commission]] in [[London]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://www.malawihighcommission.co.uk/ |access-date=2025-04-24 |website=Malawi High Commission UK |language=en-gb}}</ref>\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Mauritania}}||<!--Date started-->2004||\n*Mauritania is represented in Iceland by its embassy in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> \n*Iceland is represented in Mauritania by its [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Iceland)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] in [[Reykjavík]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.government.is/default.aspx?pageid=1f8da4f9-4146-48d3-b5ee-bd541b5f6d90&itemid=288a0160-f204-11e7-9423-005056bc530c|title = Máritanía}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{Flag|Sierra Leone}}\n|<!--Date started-->2006\n|\n* Iceland has an embassy in [[Freetown]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Embassy Information |url=https://www.government.is/diplomatic-missions/embassy-of-iceland-in-freetown/embassy-information/ |access-date=2025-04-24 |website=www.government.is |language=en-US}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{Flag|Uganda}}\n|<!--Date started-->2004\n|\n* Iceland has an embassy in [[Kampala]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Embassy Information |url=https://www.government.is/diplomatic-missions/embassy-of-iceland-in-kampala/embassy-information/ |access-date=2025-04-24 |website=www.government.is |language=en-US}}</ref>\n|}\n\n=== Americas ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Diplomatic Relations Established\n!Notes\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Canada }}||<!--Date started-->1947||See [[Canada–Iceland relations]]\n* Canada has an embassy in Reykjavík.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/iceland-islande/index.aspx?lang=eng|title=Embassy of Canada|access-date=20 February 2015|date=24 November 2011}}</ref>\n* Iceland has an embassy in [[Ottawa]] and a consulate-general in [[Winnipeg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iceland.is/iceland-abroad/ca|title=Canada – Ottawa|website=The Icelandic Foreign Services|access-date=20 February 2015|archive-date=1 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001201329/https://www.iceland.is/iceland-abroad/ca|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Dominica}}||<!--Date started-->2004||\n*Both countries established diplomatic relations in 2004.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iceland.is/iceland-abroad/un/nyc/embassy|title=Embassy|website=iceland.is|access-date=23 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612184723/https://www.iceland.is/iceland-abroad/un/nyc/embassy|archive-date=12 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n*Iceland is represented in Dominica through its embassy in New York City, United States.
