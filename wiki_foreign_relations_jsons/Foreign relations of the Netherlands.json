"{{Short description|None}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2018}}\n{{Politics of the Netherlands}}The '''foreign policy of the Netherlands''' is based on four basic commitments: to the [[Atlanticism|Atlantic cooperation]], to [[European integration]], to [[international development]] and to [[international law]]. While historically the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was a neutral state, since 1945 it has become a member of [[NATO]], the [[United Nations]], the [[European Union]] and many other international organizations. The Dutch economy is very open and relies on international trade. During and after the 17th century—its [[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age]]—the Dutch built up a commercial and colonial empire. It was a leading shipping and naval power and was often at war with England, its main rival. Its main colonial holding was Indonesia, which fought for and achieved independence after 1945. The historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands.  Foreign trade policy is handled by the European Union.  The Dutch have been active in international peacekeeping roles.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Netherlands}}\n{{More citations needed|section|date=July 2021}}\n[[File:Verwantschapslanden.png|thumb|260px|Former colonial possessions of the [[Dutch Empire]].]]\nIn the [[Dutch Golden Age]], which had its zenith around 1667, there was a flowering of trade, industry, the arts and the [[List of people from the Dutch Golden Age#Science|sciences]]. A rich worldwide [[Dutch empire]] developed and the [[Dutch East India Company]] became one of the earliest and most important of national mercantile companies based on entrepreneurship and trade.\n\nDuring the 18th century, the power and wealth of the Netherlands declined. A series of wars with the more powerful [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|British]] and [[Franco-Dutch War|French]] neighbors weakened it. Britain seized the North American colony of [[New Amsterdam]], turning it into New York. There was growing unrest and [[Second Stadtholderless Period#Crisis and the Orangist revolution of 1747|conflict]] between the [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangists]] and the [[Patriottentijd|Patriots]]. The French Revolution spilled over after 1789, and a pro-French [[Batavian Republic]] was established in 1795–1806. Napoleon made it a satellite state, the [[Kingdom of Holland]] (1806–1810), and later simply a French imperial province.\n\nIn 1815–1940 it was neutral and played a minor role in world diplomacy, apart from a failed effort to control the seceding Southern provinces that became Belgium [[Belgian Revolution|before giving up in 1839.]]<ref>A. Vandenbosch, ''Dutch Foreign Policy since 1815'' (1959).</ref>\n\nUnlike most European countries, the Netherlands succeeded in [[Netherlands in World War I|remaining neutral throughout]] [[World War I|The Great War]]. This approach failed during the [[World War II|Second World War]] however and the kingdom quickly fell to an unprovoked [[German invasion of the Netherlands|German invasion in 1940]] and would remain under Nazi occupation until being liberated by the allies in 1945. After the war, as a member of the allies, the Netherlands was included in the first class of U.N. members. During the [[Cold War]] like most Western European countries, the Dutch aligned with the United States against the [[Soviet Union]], co-founding the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)]], in 1949.<ref>Cees Wiebes and Bert Zeeman, \"The Pentagon Negotiations March 1948: The Launching of the North Atlantic Treaty.\" International Affairs 59.3 (1983): 351-363.</ref><ref name=history>{{cite web |url= http://nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_139339.htm |title= A short history of NATO |publisher= NATO |access-date= 22 September 2021 |archive-date= March 26, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170326231233/http://nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_139339.htm |url-status= live }}</ref> The Dutch were also at the forefront of promoting European cooperation and integration during this time period; co-founding the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] and becoming one of the [[European Union|European Union's]] (EU) original members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/eu-history/1945-1959/index_en.htm|title=A peaceful Europe&nbsp;– the beginnings of cooperation|publisher=European Commission|access-date=22 September 2021|archive-date=July 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726062045/http://europa.eu/about-eu/eu-history/1945-1959/index_en.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==European integration==\nThe Dutch have been strong advocates of European integration, and most aspects of their foreign, economic, and trade policies are coordinated through the [[European Union]] (EU). The Dutch postwar customs union with [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]] (the [[Benelux]] group) paved the way for the formation of the European Community (precursor to the EU), of which the Netherlands was a founding member. Likewise, the Benelux abolition of internal border controls was a model for the wider [[Schengen treaty|Schengen Accord]], which today has 29 European signatories (including the Netherlands) pledged to common visa policies and free movement of people across common borders.\n\nThe Dutch stood at the cradle of the 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]] and have been the architects of the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] concluded in 1998. The Dutch have thus played an important role in European political and monetary integration; indeed, until the year 2003, Dutchman [[Wim Duisenberg]] headed the European Central Bank. In addition, Dutch financial minister Gerrit Zalm was the main critic of the violation of the [[Stability and Growth Pact]] by France and Germany in 2004 and 2005.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2004-06-23 |title=Colourful money man |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/colourful-money-man/ |access-date=2023-10-25 |website=POLITICO |language=en |archive-date=September 24, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230924151915/https://www.politico.eu/article/colourful-money-man/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Involvement in developing countries==\n{{Main article|Netherlands Development Cooperation}}\n\nThe Netherlands was the 9th-largest donor country in 2021, giving about $5&nbsp;billion, about 0.5% of its gross national income (GNI), in official development assistance (ODA).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Donor Profile: Netherlands |url=https://donortracker.org/donor_profiles/netherlands |access-date=2023-06-12 |website=donortracker.org |archive-date=June 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230612131130/https://donortracker.org/donor_profiles/netherlands |url-status=live }}</ref> The country contributes through multilateral channels, especially the [[United Nations Development Programme]], the international financial institutions, and EU programs.

These projects included improving environmental conditions and support for multilateral programs in cooperation with local non-governmental organizations. In 1998, the Dutch provided significant amounts of aid to the former Yugoslavia and Africa. The Dutch consistently provide significant amounts of [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian relief aid]] to the victims of the worst natural disasters, such as [[Hurricane Mitch]] in [[Central America]] in 1998, the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] in [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]], [[Hurricane Katrina]] in the [[United States]] in 2005, the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], and more recent catastrophes in [[Pakistan]] and [[Burma]] including [[Typhoon Haiyan]] in the [[Philippines]] in 2013, and the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|2015 Nepal earthquake]].<ref>{{Cite journal |title=All Past Emergencies and Disasters |url=https://www.redcross.ca/how-we-help/current-emergency-responses/past-emergency-responses/past-emergencies-and-disasters |journal=Canadian Red Cross |access-date=April 25, 2022 |archive-date=April 19, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220419195611/https://www.redcross.ca/how-we-help/current-emergency-responses/past-emergency-responses/past-emergencies-and-disasters |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Export assistance grants==\n\"Developing countries aspiring to purchase foreign goods and services to invest in, inter alia, port facilities, roads, public transport, health care, or drinking water facilities may be eligible for a special Dutch grant facility.

The children had been living in Syria since 2004, after an alleged [[Child abduction#International child abduction|international child abduction]] by the father from the Netherlands to Syria, during a [[contact (law)|family contact]] in which he supposedly would visit Paris with them. The children fled to the embassy because they would like to live with their mother in the Netherlands. [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Ben Bot]] traveled to Damascus, negotiated and on December 22 the children finally could return to the Netherlands.\n\nThe father claims that the Dutch government has promised not to prosecute him for the abduction.

The Netherlands was an ally to South Korea throughout the war, against communist [[North Korea]] (backed by the Soviet Union). The Netherlands still monitors developments between South Korea and North Korea with interest, and remain an ally.
