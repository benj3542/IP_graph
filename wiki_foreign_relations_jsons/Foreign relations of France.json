It was humiliated in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71, which marked the rise of [[German Empire|Germany]] to dominance in Europe. [[Allies of WWI|France allied with Great Britain and Russia]] and was on the winning side of the First World War. Although it was initially easily defeated early in the Second World War, [[Free France]], through its Free French Forces and the [[French Resistance|Resistance]], continued to fight against the [[Axis powers]] as an [[Allied nation]] and was ultimately considered one of the victors of the war, as the allocation of a French [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|occupation zone in Germany]] and [[West Berlin]] testifies, as well as the status of permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council]]. It fought losing colonial wars in [[First Indochina War|Indochina]] (ending in 1954) and [[Algerian War|Algeria]] (ending in 1962). The Fourth Republic collapsed and the Fifth Republic began in 1958 to the present. Under [[Charles de Gaulle]] it tried to block American and British influence on the European community. Since 1945, France has been a founding member of the [[United Nations]], of [[NATO]], and of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (the [[European Union]]'s predecessor). As a charter member of the United Nations, France holds one of the permanent seats in the [[Security Council]] and is a member of most of its [[United Nations System|specialized and related agencies]].\n\nFrance is also a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]] and the [[La Francophonie]] and plays a key role, both in regional and in international affairs.\n\nOn February 14, 2023, as part of their foreign policy in human rights, France showed its support for international justice by signing the Ljubljana-Hague Convention on International Cooperation in the Investigation and Prosecution of Genocide, Crimes against Humanity, War Crimes, and other International Crimes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fight against impunity – Signing of the Ljubljana-Hague Convention on International Cooperation in the Investigation and Prosecution of the Crime of Genocide, Crimes against Humanity, War Crimes and other International Crimes (14 Feb. 2024) |url=https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/human-rights/news/article/fight-against-impunity-signing-of-the-ljubljana-hague-convention-on |access-date=2024-02-21 |website=France Diplomacy - Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Fifth Republic since 1981==\n\n===François Mitterrand: 1981–1995===\n{{Main|Foreign policy of François Mitterrand}}\n\n[[François Mitterrand]], a Socialist, emphasized European unity<ref>Simon J.

They promoted French-German bilateralism in Europe and strengthened military cooperation between the two countries.\n\nAccording to Wayne Northcutt, certain domestic circumstances helped shape Mitterrand's foreign policy in four ways: he needed to maintain a political consensus; he kept an eye on economic conditions; he believed in the nationalistic imperative for French policy; and he tried to exploit Gaullism and its heritage that is on political advantage.<ref>Wayne Northcutt. \"The domestic origins of Mitterrand's foreign policy, 1981-1985.\" ''Contemporary French Civilization'' (1986), 10#2 pp 233-267</ref>\n\n===Jacques Chirac===\n{{main|Jacques Chirac#Foreign policy}}\n\nChrirac's foreign policy featured continuity.<ref>Michael Sutton, \"Chirac's foreign policy: continuity-with adjustment.\" The World Today 51.7 (1995): 135-138.</ref>  His most prominent move was a break with Washington. Along with his friend [[Vladimir Putin]] of Russia, [[Hu Jintao]] of China, and [[Gerhard Schröder]] of Germany, Chirac emerged as a leading voice against the [[Iraq War]] of 2003.

Bush]] (U.S.) and [[Tony Blair]] (Britain) during the organisation and deployment of a \"[[Coalition of the willing]]\" to forcibly remove the government of Iraq controlled by the [[Ba'ath Party]] under the dictatorship of [[Saddam Hussein]]. Despite British and American pressure, Chirac threatened to veto a resolution in the [[UN Security Council]] that would authorise the use of military force to rid [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq of alleged weapons of mass destruction]]. He rallied other governments to his position. \"Iraq today does not represent an immediate threat that justifies an immediate war\", Chirac said on 18 March 2003.

The message of \"universal\" values carried by French foreign policy has encountered much resistance, as other countries have developed following a different political trajectory than the one preached by France. By the 1990s, the country had become, in the words of [[Stanley Hoffmann]], an \"ordinary power, neither a basket case nor a challenger.\" Public opinion, especially in the United States, no longer sees France as an essential power....[However in 2015 France] mattered in world environmental affairs with....the [[Paris Agreement]], a global accord to reduce carbon emissions.<ref>Sophie Meunier,

(1920).png|thumb|280px|right|The [[French colonial empire]] in 1920]]\nFrance established relations with the Middle East during the reign of [[Louis XIV]]. To keep [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] from intervening into its plans regarding Western Europe he lent limited support to the [[Ottoman Empire]], though the victories of [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] destroyed these plans.<ref>William Roosen, ''The age of Louis XIV: the rise of modern diplomacy'' (1976).</ref> In the nineteenth century France together with Great Britain tried to strengthen the Ottoman Empire, the now \"[[Sick man of Europe]]\", to resist Russian expansion, culminating in the [[Crimean War]].<ref>Lynn Marshall Case,  ''French opinion on war and diplomacy during the Second Empire'' (1954).</ref>\n\nFrance also pursued close relations with the semi-autonomous Egypt. In 1869 Egyptian workers -under the supervision of France- completed the [[Suez Canal]]. A rivalry emerged between France and Britain for control of Egypt, and eventually Britain emerged victorious by buying out the Egyptian [[share (finance)|share]]s of the company before the French had time to act.<ref>F. Robert Hunter, ''Egypt under the khedives, 1805–1879: from household government to modern bureaucracy'' (American Univ in Cairo Press, 1999)</ref>\n\nAfter the unification of Germany in 1871, Germany successfully attempted to co-opt France's relations with the Ottomans. In [[World War I]] the Ottoman Empire joined the [[Central Powers]], and was defeated by France and Britain. After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire France and Britain divided the Middle East between themselves. France received Syria and Lebanon.<ref>Jan Karl Tanenbaum,  \"France and the Arab Middle East, 1914–1920.\" ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' (1978): 1–50. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1006273 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===1945–1958===\n[[File:Port Said from air.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|Smoke rises from oil tanks beside the [[Suez Canal]] hit during the initial [[Suez Crisis|Anglo-French assault on Egypt]], 5 November 1956.]]\n\nThese colonies were granted independence after 1945, but France still tried to forge cultural and educational bonds between the areas, particularly with Lebanon. Relationships with Syria are more strained, due to the policies of that country. In 2005, France, along with the United States, pressured Syria to evacuate Lebanon.<ref>N. Méouchy et al. ''The British and French mandates in comparative perspectives'' (Brill, 2004)</ref>\nIn the post-World War II era French relations with the Arab Middle East reached a very low point. The [[Algerian War|war in Algeria]] between Muslim fighters and French colonists deeply concerned the rest of the Muslim world. The Algerian fighters received much of their supplies and funding from Egypt and other Arab powers, much to France's displeasure.<ref>Martin Alexander, and John FV Keiger. \"France and the Algerian War: strategy, operations and diplomacy.\" ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' 25.2 (2002): 1–32. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402390412331302635 Online]</ref>\n\nMost damaging to Franco-Arab relations, however, was the [[Suez Crisis]]. It greatly diminished France's reputation in the region. France openly supported the Israeli attack on the [[Sinai Peninsula]], and was working against [[Nasser]], then a popular figure in the Middle East. The Suez Crisis also made France and the United Kingdom look again like imperialist powers attempting to impose their will upon weaker nations.<ref>Edward E. Azar, \"Conflict escalation and conflict reduction in an international crisis: Suez, 1956\". ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'' (1972): 183–201. {{JSTOR|173313}}.</ref> Another hindrance to France's relations with the Arab Middle East was its close alliance with Israel during the 1950s.\n\n===De Gaulle's policies===\nThis all changed with the coming of [[Charles de Gaulle]] to power. De Gaulle's foreign policy was centered around an attempt to limit the power and influence of both superpowers, and at the same time increase France's international prestige.  De Gaulle hoped to move France from being a follower of the United States to becoming the leading nation of a large group of non-aligned countries. The nations de Gaulle looked at as potential participants in this group were those in France's traditional spheres of influence: Africa and the Middle East. The former French colonies in eastern and northern Africa were quite agreeable to these close relations with France.  These nations had close economic and cultural ties to France, and they also had few other suitors amongst the major powers. This new orientation of French foreign policy also appealed strongly to the leaders of the Arab nations. None of them wanted to be dominated by either of the superpowers, and they supported France's policy of trying to balance the US and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] and to prevent either from becoming dominant in the region. The Middle Eastern leaders wanted to be free to pursue their own goals and objectives, and did not want to be chained to either alliance bloc. De Gaulle hoped to use this common foundation to build strong relations between the nations. He also hoped that good relations would improve France's trade with the region. De Gaulle also imagined that these allies would look up to the more powerful French nation, and would look to it in leadership in matters of foreign policy.<ref>[[Alfred Grosser]], ''French Foreign Policy under De Gaulle'' (Greenwood Press, 1977)</ref>\n\nThe end of the [[Algerian War|Algerian conflict]] in 1962 accomplished much in this regard. France could not portray itself as a leader of the oppressed nations of the world if it still was enforcing its colonial rule upon another nation. The battle against the Muslim separatists that France waged in favour of the minority of French settlers was an extremely unpopular one throughout the Muslim world. With the conflict raging it would have been close to impossible for France to have had positive relations with the nations of the Middle East. The Middle Eastern support for the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] guerillas was another strain on relations that the end of the conflict removed. Most of the financial and material support for the FLN had come from the nations of the Middle East and North Africa. This was especially true of Nasser's Egypt, which had long supported the separatists. Egypt is also the most direct example of improved relations after the end of hostilities. The end of the war brought an immediate thaw to Franco-Egyptian relations, Egypt ended the trial of four French officers accused of espionage, and France ended its [[trade embargo]] against Egypt.\n\nIn 1967 de Gaulle completely overturned France's Israel policy. De Gaulle and his ministers reacted very harshly to Israel's actions in the [[Six-Day War]]. The French government and de Gaulle condemned Israel's treatment of refugees, warned that it was a mistake to occupy the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]], and also refused to recognize the Israeli control of [[Jerusalem]]. The French government continued to criticize Israel after the war and de Gaulle spoke out against other Israeli actions, such as the operations against the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] in Lebanon. France began to use its veto power to oppose Israel in the UN, and France sided with the Arab states on almost all issues brought to the international body. Most importantly of all, however, de Gaulle's government imposed an arms embargo on the Israeli state. The embargo was in fact applied to all the combatants, but very soon France began selling weaponry to the Arab states again. As early as 1970 France sold Libya a hundred [[Dassault Mirage]] fighter jets. However, after 1967 France continued to support Israel's [[right to exist]], as well as Israel's many preferential agreements with France and the [[European Economic Community]].\n\n===Foreign aid===\nIn the second half of the 20th century, France increased its expenditures in foreign aid greatly, to become second only to the United States in total aid amongst the Western powers and first on a per capita basis. By 1968 France was paying out $855&nbsp;million per year in aid far more than either West Germany or the United Kingdom. The vast majority of French aid was directed towards Africa and the Middle East, usually either as a lever to promote French interests or to help with the sale of French products (e.g. arms sales). France also increased its expenditures on other forms of aid sending out skilled individuals to developing countries to provide technical and cultural expertise.<ref>Robert D. McKinlay, \"The Aid Relationship A Foreign Policy Model and Interpretation of the Distributions of Official Bilateral Economic Aid of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, 1960–1970.\" ''Comparative Political Studies'' (1979) 11#4 pp: 411–464.</ref>\n\nThe combination of aid money, arms sales, and diplomatic alignments helped to erase the memory of the [[Suez Crisis]] and the Algerian War in the Arab world and France successfully developed amicable relationships with the governments of many of the Middle Eastern states. Nasser and de Gaulle, who shared many similarities, cooperated on limiting American power in the region.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Furniss |first=Edgar S. |date=1961 |title=De Gaulle's France and NATO: An Interpretation |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2705337 |journal=International Organization |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=349–365 |doi=10.1017/S0020818300002186 |jstor=2705337 |issn=0020-8183|url-access=subscription }}</ref> Nasser proclaimed France as the only friend of Egypt in the West.

France improved relations with its former colony Syria, and eroded cultural links were partially restored.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}\n\nIn terms of trade France did receive some benefits from the improved relations with the Middle East. French trade with the Middle East increased by over fifty percent after de Gaulle's reforms. The weaponry industries benefited most as France soon had lucrative contracts with many of the regimes in the Middle East and North Africa, though these contracts account for a negligible part of France's economy.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}\n\nDe Gaulle had hoped that by taking a moderate path and not strongly supporting either side France could take part in the Middle East peace process between Israel and the Arab nations.

relations==\n===Africa===\n{{Main|France–Africa relations}}\nFrance plays a significant role in Africa, especially in its former [[French colonial empires|colonies]], through extensive aid programs, commercial activities, military agreements, and cultural impact. In those former colonies where the French presence remains important, France contributes to political, military, and social stability.  Many think that French policy in Africa – particularly where British interests are also involved – is susceptible to what is known as '[[Fashoda syndrome]]'. Others have criticized the relationship as [[neocolonialism]] under the name ''[[Françafrique]]'', stressing France's support of various dictatorships, among others: [[Omar Bongo]], [[Idriss Déby]], and [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]]. The Defense Agreements between France and French-speaking African countries established close cooperation, particularly in defense and security matters. Often accompanied by secret clauses, they allowed France to intervene militarily: to rescue regimes in order to establish the legitimacy of political powers favorable to its interests, to fight jihadism, particularly in the Sahel, or to put an end to civil wars. The departure of French troops from the African continent signals the end of a world, that of interventions in Chad, Togo, Gabon, Rwanda, Djibouti, Zaire, Somalia, Ivory Coast, Mali, Libya, and Cameroon. It also marks the end of ''Françafrique''.<ref>{{Cite web |language=fr |title=The end of the Defense agreements between France and its former African colonies |url=https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceculture/podcasts/ils-ont-change-le-monde/7-10-les-accords-la-fin-des-accords-de-defense-entre-la-france-et-ses-ex-colonies-africaines-7412378 |website=radiofrance.fr |date=2025-07-22 |accessdate=2025-07-22}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal relations began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Algeria }}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Algeria–France relations]]\n\nRelations between post-colonial Algeria and France have remained close throughout the years, although sometimes difficult. In 1962, the [[Évian Accords]] peace treaty laid the foundations of a new Franco-Algerian relationship. In exchange for a generous ''coopération'' regime (massive financial, technical and cultural aid), France secured a number of economic and military privileges. Economically, France enjoyed a preferential treatment vis-à-vis the Saharan wealth of hydrocarbons. Militarily, it could keep the Mers-el-Kébir base for 15 years and use the Saharan nuclear test-sites for another five years. France had used these sites to carry out its first nuclear tests (''[[Gerboise bleue]]'') in 1960. 90% or more of the Europeans established in Algeria (''[[pieds-noirs]]'') left the country in a massive exodus creating a difficult void in the bureaucratic, economic and educational structure of Algeria. On the other hand, the issue of the ''[[harki]]s'', the Arabs who had fought on the French side during the war, was still to be resolved at the turn of the 21st century, being somehow ignored by the French while seen as outright traitors by the Algerian people. On the economical level, Algeria remained for some time the fourth largest importer of French goods, conducting all its transactions with France in the Franc zone. Many Algerians were encouraged by French authorities and businessmen to migrate to France in order to provide workforce during the ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' (Thirty Glorious) growth. Relations between France and Algeria have remained closely intertwined, and France could not entirely escape from the chaos which threatened Algeria during the [[Algerian Civil War|civil war in the nineties]].\n\n[[Ahmed Ben Bella]], the first President of Algeria was reported in a 2001 interview as saying that \"The Algerian people have lived with blood. We brought [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] to his knees. We struggled against [[French rule in Algeria|French rule]] for 15 years under the leadership of [[Emir Abdel-Kader Al-Jazairi]]. The Algerian population was then four million. French repression cost us two million lives. It was genocide. We survived as a people. Barbaric French atrocities did not subdue our fighting spirit.\"<ref>{{cite news\n |title        = Ahmed Ben Bella: Plus ça change\n |url          = http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/533/profile.htm\n |work         = [[Al-Ahram Weekly]]\n |date         = 16 May 2001\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070715011923/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/533/profile.htm\n |archive-date = 15 July 2007\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 February 2005, the [[French law on colonialism]] was an act passed by the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) conservative majority, which imposed on high-school (lycée) teachers to teach the \"positive values\" of [[colonialism]] to their students (article 4). The law created a public uproar and opposition from the whole of the left-wing, and was finally repealed by president [[Jacques Chirac]] (UMP) at the beginning of 2006, after accusations of [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]] from various teachers and historians.\n\nAlgerians feared that the French law on colonialism would hinder the task the French confronting the dark side of their colonial rule in Algeria because article 4 of the law decreed among other things that \"School programmes are to recognise in particular the positive role of the French presence overseas, especially in North Africa, ...\"<ref name=HS-050516>{{cite news\n|title=Colonial abuses haunt France\n|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4552473.stm\n|work=BBC News\n|author=Hugh Schofiel\n|date=16 May 2005 | access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref> [[Benjamin Stora]] a leading specialist on French Algerian history and an opponent of the French law on colonialism, said \"France has never taken on its colonial history. It is a big difference with the Anglo-Saxon countries, where post-colonial studies are now in all the universities. We are phenomenally behind the times.\"<ref name=HS-050516/> In his opinion, although the historical facts were known to academics, they were not well known by the French public and this led to a lack of honesty in France over French colonial treatment of the Algerian people.<ref name=HS-050516/>\n\nDuring the period that the French law on colonialism was in force, several Algerians and others raised issues and made comments to emphasise that there were many aspects of French colonial rule that were not widely known in France.<ref name=HS-050516/> A senior Algerian official Mohamed El Korso said that \"[French] repentance is seen by the Algerian people as a ''[[sine qua non]]'' before any Franco-Algerian friendship treaty can be concluded.\" and with reference to the [[Setif massacre]] that \"French and international public opinion must know that France committed a real act of genocide in May 1945\"<ref name=HS-050516/> The Algerian president [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] said Algeria had \"never ceased waiting for an admission from France of all the acts committed during the colonial period and the war of liberation.\" and drew comparisons between the burning of the bodies of the victims of the Setif massacre with the crematoria in the Nazi death camps.<ref name=HS-050516/> More recently on 17 April 2006, Bouteflika emphasised Algeria's point of view when said in a speech in Paris that \"Colonization brought the genocide of our identity, of our history, of our language, of our traditions\".<ref name=\"The Scotsman1\">\n{{cite news|title=Algerian leader calls colonisation 'genocide' |url=http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=583792006 |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=18 April 2006}}</ref>\n\nFrench authorities responded to the claims by President Bouteflika and others by playing down the comments, urging \"mutual respect\" French Foreign Minister [[Michel Barnier]] told Algeria in an official visit to make a common effort to search history \"in order to establish a common future and overcome the sad pages\". In an interview with El Vatan, an Algerian newspaper, Barnier said that \"Historians from two sides must be encouraged to work together.

This operation included sending 1500 European troops to the DRC to support fair and regular presidential elections in June 2006. While Germany leads the mission, both France and Germany provide 500 soldiers each, with the rest of the soldiers coming from other European countries.\n\nMany scholars of the European Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) question whether the mission is of great use, and argue that it is rather symbolic in character. With 17,000 United Nations forces already deployed in the DRC the purpose of such a small operation remains questionable. The European troops will be stationed in the capital-city Kinshasa only. It is probable however, that the expertise of former peace-building missions on the Balkans will be useful in order to prevent any major escalation during the elections.\n\nIn 2013, France's [[François Hollande|then president]] on his visit to DRC suggested that [[Trial and conviction of Joshua French and Tjostolv Moland|prisoners Joshua French and Tjostolv Moland]] should be moved out of the situation of their six-man prison cell; five days later the two prisoners shared a cell of their own.<ref name=France-president>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10072009|title=Moland og French har fått egen celle etter hjelp fra François Hollande|work=VG|access-date=19 February 2015|date=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n* DR Congo has an embassy in Paris.\n* France has an embassy in [[Kinshasa]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flagu|Djibouti }}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Djibouti–France relations]]\n\n* Djibouti has an embassy in Paris\n* France has an embassy in [[Djibouti City]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flagu|Egypt}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Egypt–France relations]]\n\n* Egypt has an embassy in Paris.\n* France has an embassy in [[Cairo]] and a consulate-general in [[Alexandria]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flagu|Equatorial Guinea}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Equatorial Guinea has an embassy in Paris.\n* France has an embassy in [[Malabo]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flagu|Ethiopia }}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Ethiopia has an embassy in Paris.\n* France has an embassy in [[Addis Ababa]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flagu|Gabon }}||<!--Date started-->||See [[France–Gabon relations]]\n\nSince independence, Gabon has been \"one of France's closest allies in Africa\".<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssEnergyNews/idUSL0493323920080304 Gabon threatens France with tit-for-tat deportation] by Antoine Lawson, [[Reuters]], 4 March 2008</ref> As of 2008, around 10,000 French nationals lived and worked in Gabon, while the 6th Marine Infantry Battalion of the [[Structure of the French Army#Units permanently deployed overseas|French military]] is also stationed there.\n* France has an embassy in [[Libreville]].\n* Gabon has an embassy in Paris.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flagu|Ghana }}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* France has an embassy in [[Accra]].\n* Ghana has an embassy in Paris.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flagu|Guinea }}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* France has an embassy in [[Conakry]].\n* Guinea has an embassy in Paris.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flagu|Ivory Coast}}||<!--Date started-->\n|See [[France–Ivory Coast relations]]\nIn 2002 and 2003, France participated in military interventions in Côte d'Ivoire in [[Opération Licorne]] and [[United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire|UNOCI]].

Under French president [[Charles de Gaulle]] France opposed on several occasions the UK joining the European Economic Community (as the EU was then called).  De Gaulle argued that the UK had extensive alliances outside Europe, especially with the United States, and was famously suspicious of its European neighbours. After the UK joined the EEC, British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] argued for and won a reduction of its contributions to the EEC budget.

Bilateral relations have been good since [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], with both countries working extremely closely during either conflicts, but the relationship was severely jeopardised by the [[sinking of the Rainbow Warrior]] in [[Auckland]] on 10 July 1985 by French ''Direction Générale de la Sécurité Extérieure'' ([[DGSE]]) agents. New Zealand was put under fierce economic strain by France following the attack with [[French Government]] demanding the agents who carried out the attack to be released by the New Zealand government. Since then there has been some animosity among New Zealanders towards the French, but since the 20th anniversary of the bombing in 2005, there were signs that New Zealand had begun to warm to the French. There has been speculation that this acceptance of the French by the New Zealand people has a lot to do with the [[History of rugby union matches between All Blacks and France|historic rivalry]] between both countries' Rugby teams.\n* France has an embassy in [[Wellington]].\n* New Zealand has an embassy in Paris.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flagu|Papua New Guinea }}||<!--Date started-->1976||See [[France–Papua New Guinea relations]]\n\nRelations between the French Republic and the Independent State of Papua New Guinea are limited but cordial.
