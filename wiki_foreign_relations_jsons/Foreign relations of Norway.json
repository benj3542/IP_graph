"{{Short description|none}} <!-- \"none\" is preferred when the title is sufficiently descriptive; see [[WP:SDNONE]] -->\n{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2016}}\n{{Politics of Norway}}\n\nThe '''foreign relations of Norway''' are based on the country's membership in [[NATO]] and within the workings of the United Nations (UN). Additionally, despite not being a member of the [[European Union]] (EU), Norway takes a part in the [[European integration|integration]] of EU through its membership in the [[European Economic Area]]. [[Norway]]'s foreign ministry includes both the minister of foreign affairs and minister of international development.\n\n==History==\n{{Further|History of Norway}}\nThe [[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] was established on the same day that Norway [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|declared the dissolution of the union]] with Sweden: June 7, 1905. Although diplomats could not present credentials to foreign governments until the Swedish king formally renounced his right to the Norwegian throne, a number of unofficial representatives worked on the provisional government's behalf until the first Norwegian ambassador, [[Hjalmar Christian Hauge]], sought accreditation by the United States Secretary of State [[Elihu Root]] on November 6, 1905.\n\nThe initial purposes of the newly formed Foreign Ministry were to represent Norway's interests through diplomatic channels, and to provide consular services for Norwegian shipping and commerce overseas. In 1906, the [[Storting]] decided to establish six embassies in Europe, with two more in the Americas: one in the United States and one in [[Argentina]]. 20 consular offices were also opened.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the foreign ministry was confronted with unprecedented challenges in maintaining neutrality for Norway, in particular in order to protect its merchant fleet.\n\nIn 1922, the ministry was consolidated and reorganised to ensure fuller cooperation between the diplomatic and consular branches. The reorganization included the formation of a designated career path for diplomats that included completion of a university entrance examination and professional experience from international trade. The economic hardship of the times forced austerity measures at the ministry for the next several years.\n\nWhen Norway was [[Operation Weserübung|invaded by Nazi Germany]] in 1940, the [[Government in exile|government fled]] to the United Kingdom and reconstituted in exile in [[Bracknell]], outside London. [[Kingston House estate, London|Kingston House]] in London was later used. The government moved back to Norway following the peace in 1945.\n\nAfter the end of [[World War II]], Norway was a founding member of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and the United Nations, the latter having Norwegian [[Trygve Lie]] as inaugural [[United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]]. Norway was also part of the first slate of non-permanent members to the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Hanhimäki|first=Jussi M.|title=1. The best hope of mankind?

Norway became a founding [[Member states of NATO|member of NATO]] in order to ally itself with countries that shared its democratic values.  Both through diplomatic and military cooperation, Norway has played a visible role in the formation and operations of NATO.  It allowed a limited number of military bases and exercises to be based in its territories, which caused some controversy when NATO decided to put [[Forward operating base|forward bases]] in [[Northern Norway]] in preparation for a conflict with the [[Soviet Union]].{{citation needed|date=March 2023}}\n\n===International cooperation===\n[[Norway]] supports international cooperation and the peaceful settlement of disputes, recognizing the need for maintaining a strong national defence through [[collective security]]. Accordingly, the cornerstones of Norwegian policy are active membership in [[NATO]] and support for the United Nations and its specialized agencies. Norway also pursues a policy of economic, social, and cultural cooperation with other Nordic countries—[[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], and [[Iceland]]—through the [[Nordic Council]]. Its relations with [[Iceland]] are very close due to the cultural bond the two nations share. Norway ended a 2-year term on the [[UN Security Council]] in January 2003, and chaired the [[Iraq Sanctions Committee]].\n\nNorway, along with Iceland and the [[Faroe Islands]], is not a member of the [[European Union]], {{clarify span|all three are members of the [[European Economic Area]]|reason=In what way are the Faroes an EEA member?|date=March 2024}}.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bergmann|first=Eirikur|title=Iceland and the International Financial Crisis|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2014|location=London}}</ref> Membership of the EU has been proposed within Norway, and referendums over Norwegian membership were held in 1972 and 1994.<ref>{{cite web |title=Historical overview - Norway and the EU |date=July 12, 2022 |url=https://www.norway.no/en/missions/eu/areas-of-cooperation/historical-overview/ |access-date=31 March 2023}}</ref> Popular opinion was split between rural and urban areas. ''See [[Norway and the European Union]].'' The present government is not planning to raise the possibility for future membership.\n\nNorway also has a history of co-operation and friendship with the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Scotland]], due to their shared cultural heritage since [[Viking Age|Viking times]]. The Vikings conquered areas including the [[Hebrides]], [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] for several hundred years. Norway is only 300 kilometres (159 [[Nautical miles]]) east of [[Unst]], the northernmost island of Shetland.  The [[Embassy of Norway, London|Norwegian embassy to the United Kingdom]] is located in London, and Norway also maintains a Consulate General in [[Edinburgh]]. A [[Picea abies|Norway Spruce]] is given by the city of Oslo and presented to London as a Christmas tree for display in [[Trafalgar Square]] as a token of gratitude for the UK's support during [[World War II]].  King [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon]], his son [[Olav V of Norway|Crown Prince Olav]] and the country's [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|government lived in exile]] in London throughout the war. As part of the tradition, the Lord Mayor of Westminster visits Oslo in the late autumn to take part in the felling of the tree, and the Mayor of Oslo then goes to London to light the tree at the Christmas ceremony.\n\nOn 25 April 2022, Norwegian foreign minister visited [[Bangladesh]] as part of her two-day trip in order to broaden economic partnership through trade, [[investment]] and maritime sector cooperation.<ref>{{cite web |last=Report |first=Star Digital |date=2022-04-25 |title=Norway seeks to expand cooperation in offshore renewable energy, investment in Bangladesh |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/diplomacy/news/norway-seeks-expand-cooperation-offshore-renewable-energy-investment-bangladesh-3011986 |access-date=2022-04-25 |website=The Daily Star |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===International mediation and nation building===\n\nNorway has played an active role as a third party mediator in a number of international conflicts.  The late foreign minister [[Johan Jørgen Holst]] was instrumental in forging the [[Oslo Accords]] between [[Israel]] and the [[PLO]].  [[Thorvald Stoltenberg]] was part of the unsuccessful mediation team in seeking an end to the war in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]].  Norway has contributed both mediation services and financial assistance in [[Guatemala]].\n\nAs of 2005, Norwegian diplomats are acting as mediators in [[Sudan]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Colombia]]. Some of those countries accuse Norway of supporting and propping up separatist groups.  [[Israel]] is often bitter with harsh criticisms from Norwegian politicians. The spat was at its highest when finance minister [[Kristin Halvorsen]] supported [[Boycotts of Israel|boycott of Israeli goods]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article1196096.ece |title= USA threats after boycott support |work= Aftenposten |date= December 12, 2006 |access-date= 2008-01-14 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080103202837/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article1196096.ece |archive-date= January 3, 2008 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> in early 2006.
