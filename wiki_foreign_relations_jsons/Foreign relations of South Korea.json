The Philippines was one of the first countries that extended diplomatic recognition to South Korea.

After the war, the Philippines provided development assistance to South Korea and helped the country rebuild itself.\n\nSince then, the Philippines's relations with South Korea have evolved with South Korea becoming one of the Philippines's most important bilateral partners aside from the United States, China and Japan.

The first stage was between 1972 and 1973; the second stage was [[Pyongyang]] North Korea's delivery of relief goods to South Korea after a typhoon caused devastating floods in 1984 and the third stage was the exchange of home visits and performing artists in 1985. The fourth stage, activated by Nordpolitik under Roh, was represented by expanding public and private contacts between the two Koreas. The fifth stage was improved following the 1997 election of [[Kim Dae-jung]]. His \"[[Sunshine Policy]]\" of engagement with North Korea set the stage for the historic June 2000 [[Inter-Korean summit]].\n\nThe possibility of [[Korean reunification]] has remained a prominent topic. However, no peace treaty has yet been signed with the North. In June 2000, a historic first North Korea-South Korea summit took place, part of the South Korea's continuing [[Sunshine Policy]] of engagement. Since then, regular contacts have led to a cautious thaw. President Kim was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2000 for the policy.\n\nWith that policy, continued by the following administration of president [[Roh Moo-hyun]], economic ties between the two countries have increased, humanitarian aid has been sent to North Korea and some divided families have been briefly reunited. Military ties remain fraught with tension, however, and in 2002 a brief naval skirmish left four South Korean sailors dead, leaving the future of the Sunshine policy uncertain. The North Korea cut off talks but the South remained committed to the policy of reconciliation and relations began to thaw again.
