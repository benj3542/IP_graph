Promoting regional stability, Bulgaria hosted a Southeast European Foreign Ministers meeting in July 1996, and an [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] conference on [[Black Sea]] cooperation in November 1995. Bulgaria also participated in the 1996 South [[Balkans|Balkan]] Defense Ministerial in [[Albania]] and it is active in the [[Southeast European Cooperative Initiative]]. Since the group's inception in 2015 Bulgaria has been a part of the [[B9 format]], a subset of Eastern European NATO countries. The [[Republic of North Macedonia]] plays an important role in Bulgarian foreign and domestic policy due to historical, ethnic and cultural ties.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Flags of Nato, Bulgaria, European Union - Military club, Plovdiv, Bulgaria.JPG|thumb|250px|Flags of NATO, Bulgaria, European Union at the Military club of [[Plovdiv]], [[Bulgaria]].|left]]\nAfter the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] in Eastern Europe in 1989, Bulgaria sought economic cooperative arrangements with Germany, Italy, France, Portugal, and Spain, as well as military cooperation with Romania, Greece, and Turkey. A start was made on easing tensions with its historical adversary Serbia.<ref>Stephane Lefebvre, \"Bulgaria's foreign relations in the post-communist era: a general overview and assessment.\" ''East European Quarterly'' 28.4 (1994): 453-471.</ref>\n\nDue to close historical, cultural, and economic ties, Bulgaria sought a mutually beneficial relationship with [[Russia]], on which it largely depends for energy supplies.{{citation needed|date=April 2023}}\n\nBulgaria's [[European Union Association Agreement|EU Association Agreement]] came into effect in 1994, and Bulgaria formally applied for full EU membership in December 1995. During the 1999 EU summit in Helsinki, the country was invited to start membership talks with the Union. On January 1, 2007, Bulgaria officially became a member of the European Union. In 1996, Bulgaria acceded to the [[Wassenaar Arrangement]] controlling exports of weapons and sensitive technology to countries of concern and also was admitted to the [[World Trade Organization]]. Bulgaria is a member of the [[Zangger Committee]] and the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]]. After a period of equivocation under a socialist government, in March 1997 a [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|UDF]]-led caretaker cabinet applied for full [[NATO]] membership, which became a reality in April 2004.\n\nBulgaria and the United States signed a Defense Cooperation Agreement in 2006 providing for military bases and training camps of the [[List of joint US-Bulgarian military bases|U.S. Army in Bulgaria]], as part of the Pentagon's restructuring plan.{{citation needed|date=April 2023}}\n\nThe [[HIV trial in Libya]] resulted in the release of Bulgarian nurses imprisoned by [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s government in Libya.
