"{{Short description|none}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2025}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2025}}\n{{Politics of Malta}}\n\nAfter [[History of Malta|independence]] from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1964, [[Malta]] followed a policy of close co-operation with [[NATO]] countries. Since 1971, the country sought relations with the rest of the world, including communist countries in Eastern Europe and the non-aligned countries.\n\nAfter substantially increased financial contributions from several NATO countries (including the United States), the [[Royal Navy]] remained in the [[Malta Dockyard]] until 1979. Following their departure, Malta charted a new course of neutrality and became an active member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. The country [[Malta and the Non-Aligned Movement|joined the Non-Aligned Movement in 1973]] as the third [[Europe|European]] member state after [[Cyprus and the Non-Aligned Movement|Cyprus]] and [[Yugoslavia and the Non-Aligned Movement|SFR Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\"Bishku\">{{cite journal |last1=Bishku |first1=Michael B. |date=2015 |title=The Middle Eastern Relations of Cyprus and Malta: From Independence to Nonalignment to the European Union. |journal= [[Mediterranean Quarterly]] |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=42–62 |doi=10.1215/10474552-2914506 |s2cid=153673424 }}</ref> Malta is an active participant in the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], the [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], and various other international organisations. In these forums, Malta has frequently expressed its concern for the peace and economic development of the [[Mediterranean region]].\n\nOn May 1, 2004, Malta withdrew from the Non-Aligned Movement and became a [[Member state of the European Union|full member]] of the [[European Union]], with which it had an association agreement since 1971. It was one of ten [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|new members which joined on that date]]. The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Malta)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]], at [[Palazzo Parisio (Valletta)|Palazzo Parisio]], oversees the direction of Maltese foreign policy.
