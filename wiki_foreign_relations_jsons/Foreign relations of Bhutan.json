nations to maintain a residential embassy in Thimphu. Bhutan was the first country in the world to recognize [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladeshi independence]] in 1971. The two states have agreed to develop [[hydropower]] in the Himalayas, as well as initiate [[free trade]] and [[transshipment]] through Bangladeshi ports. They also cooperate in water resources management.\nBoth Bhutan and Bangladesh are members of [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|SAARC]] and [[Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation|BIMSTEC]].\n\n===China===\n{{Main article|Bhutan–China relations}}\n\nBhutan has no diplomatic relations with its northern neighbor, the [[China|People's Republic of China]], and is one of the few countries that do not recognise or have relations with either of the [[Two Chinas]]. The border between Bhutan and the PRC has been closed since the [[Battle of Chamdo|invasion of Tibet]] in 1950, which caused an influx of refugees. The border also remains undelineated; in 1961 China published a map that altered the traditional border.<ref>{{cite book |title= Nepal and Bhutan: country studies |publisher=[[Federal Research Division]] |last1=Savada |first1=Andrea Matles |last2=Harris |first2=George Lawrence |year=1993 |url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/cntrystd.bt |page=332 |quote=The specter of renewed Chinese claims to Bhutan, Sikkim, and Nepal was raised after China published a map in 1961 that showed alterations of traditional Sino-Bhutanese and other Himalayan borders in Beijing's favor}}</ref> Tensions have since lessened, especially after an agreement on border peace and tranquility was signed in 1998: the first bilateral agreement between China and Bhutan. Despite the lack of formal diplomatic relations, Bhutan has also maintained an Honorary Consul in [[Macau]] since 2000 and in [[Hong Kong]] since 2004.\n\nIn late 2005, Bhutan claimed that [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] soldiers were building roads and bridges within Bhutanese territory. Bhutanese Foreign Minister Khandu Wangchuk took up the matter with Chinese authorities after the issue was raised in the Bhutanese parliament. In response, Foreign Ministry spokesman [[Qin Gang]] of the People's Republic of China has said that the border remains in dispute and that the two sides are continuing to work for a peaceful and cordial resolution of the dispute.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.china.com/zh_cn/domestic/945/20051201/12906175.html |title=中国不丹同意平等友好协商早日解决边界问题 |trans-title=China and Bhutan agree to equal and friendly consultations to resolve the border issue as soon as possible |publisher=China.com News |date=1 December 2005 |access-date=29 March 2011 |archive-date=25 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925120828/http://news.china.com/zh_cn/domestic/945/20051201/12906175.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Bhutanese newspaper ''Kuensel'' has said that China might use the roads to further Chinese claims along the border.<ref>[http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/7598_1583871,000500020006.htm Hindustan times article]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229111417/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/7598_1583871%2C000500020006.htm |date=29 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===India===\n{{Main article|Bhutan–India relations}}\n\nHistorically, ties with India have been close. Both countries signed a first ever Friendship treaty in 1865 between Bhutan and British India. When Bhutan became a monarchy, British India was the first country to recognize it and renewed the treaty in 1910. Bhutan was the first country to recognize Indian independence and renewed the age old treaty with the new government in 1949, including a clause that India would assist Bhutan in foreign relations. On 8 February 2007, the Indo-Bhutan Friendship Treaty<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mea.gov.in/pressrelease/2007/03/treaty.pdf |title=Indo-Bhutan Friendship Treaty |publisher=[[Government of India]]}}</ref> was substantially revised under the Bhutanese King, [[Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck]]. In the Treaty of 1949 Article 2 read as \"The Government of India undertakes to exercise no interference in the internal administration of Bhutan. On its part the Government of Bhutan agrees to be guided by the advice of the Government of India in regard to its external relations.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mea.gov.in/treatiesagreement/1949/chap26.htm |title=Treaty of 1949 |publisher=[[Government of India]] |year=1949}}</ref> In the revised treaty this now reads as, \"In keeping with the abiding ties of close friendship and cooperation between Bhutan and India, the Government of the Kingdom of Bhutan and the Government of the Republic of India shall cooperate closely with each other on issues relating to their national interests. Neither government shall allow the use of its territory for activities harmful to the national security and interest of the other.\" The revised treaty also includes in it the preamble \"Reaffirming their respect for each other's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity\", an element that was absent in the earlier version. The Indo-Bhutan Friendship Treaty of 2007 strengthens Bhutan's status as an independent and sovereign nation.\n\nThere also exists bi-lateral agreement between Bhutanese and Indian Government wherein citizens of both nations can travel freely in other country without passport or visa.\n\n===Indonesia===\nDiplomatic relations between Indonesia and Bhutan were officially established on December 15, 2011.

Any nation, with or without formal relations, may request the extradition of fugitives who abscond to Bhutan.

The Court may then issue a summons or warrant, conduct an inquiry, and collect evidence, holding the accused for a maximum of 30 days. Alternatively, the Royal Government may refer the matter to the courts for trial within Bhutan.
