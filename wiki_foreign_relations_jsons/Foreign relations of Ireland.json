It is one of the group of smaller nations in the EU and has traditionally followed a [[Irish neutrality|non-aligned foreign policy]]. Ireland has historically tended towards independence in foreign military policy, thus it is not a member of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] and has a [[The Emergency (Ireland)#Neutrality|longstanding]] <!-- constitutional? --> policy of military neutrality.\n\n==Main relationships==\nIreland was not invited to join the United Nations when it was formed in 1945. Both Washington and London were opposed because of Ireland's neutrality during the war. Ireland applied in 1946 and the US and UK voted approval, but the Soviet Union vetoed it. Ireland was finally admitted to the UN in 1955.<ref>Ronan Fanning, \"The Anglo-American Alliance and the Irish Application for Membership of the United Nations.\" ''Irish Studies in International Affairs'' 2#2 (1986), pp. 35–61.

In 1974 it began the Irish Aid programme to provide assistance to developing countries. In 1991 it established the Irish Institute of International and European Affairs to conduct research and analysis on international and European affairs. In 1992 the [[Irish Refugee Council]] began as a humanitarian advocate for the rights of refugees and asylum seekers in Ireland.<ref>John Doyle, \"100 years of Irish Foreign Policy.\" ''Irish Studies in International Affairs'' 30.1 (2019): 1–5.</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\n[[File:Irish embassy in London.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Embassy of Ireland in London]]\n\n{{Main|Ireland–United Kingdom relations}}\n\nSince at least the 12th century Ireland, as a result of military conquest, has had political connections with the United Kingdom and its predecessor states, with the whole island becoming a part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] from 1801 to 1922. From the time Ireland became independent from the United Kingdom in 1922, the two countries have been involved in a dispute over the status of [[Northern Ireland]]. [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland]] formerly claimed Northern Ireland as a part of the ''\"national territory\"'', though in practice the Irish government did recognise the UK's jurisdiction over the region.<br />\nFrom the onset of [[the Troubles]] in 1969, the two governments sought to bring the violence to an end. The [[Sunningdale Agreement]] of 1973 and the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] of 1985 were important steps in this process. In 1998, both [[sovereign state|states]] signed the [[Good Friday Agreement]] and now co-operate closely to find a solution to the region's problems. [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland]] were amended as part of this agreement, the territorial claim being replaced with a statement of aspiration to unite the people of the island of Ireland. As part of the Good Friday Agreement, the states also ended their [[names of the Irish state|dispute over their respective names]]: ''Ireland'' and the ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland''. Each agreed to accept and use the others' correct name.\n\nWhen [[the Troubles]] were raging in Northern Ireland, the [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government]] sought, with mixed success, to prevent the import of weapons and ammunition through its territory by illegal paramilitary organisations for use in their conflict with the security forces in Northern Ireland. In 1973 three ships of the [[Naval Service (Ireland)|Irish Naval Service]] intercepted a ship carrying weapons from [[Libya]] which were probably destined for [[Irish Republican]] paramilitaries.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/13878 |title=The Claudia |newspaper=[[An Phoblacht]] |date=21 July 2005 |access-date=26 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203094037/http://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/13878 |archive-date=3 February 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Law enforcement acts such as these additionally improved relations with the government of the United Kingdom. However, the independent judiciary blocked a number of attempts to extradite suspects between 1970 and 1998 on the basis that their crime might have been 'political' and thus contrary to [[extradition#Common conditions of extradition|international law at the time]].\n\nIreland is one of the parties to the [[Rockall#Law of the Sea|Rockall continental shelf dispute]] that also involves Denmark, [[Iceland]], and the United Kingdom. Ireland and the United Kingdom have signed a boundary agreement in the Rockall area. However, neither has concluded similar agreements with Iceland or Denmark (on behalf of the [[Faroe Islands]]) and the matter remains under negotiation.

EU issues important to Ireland include the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], corporation [[tax harmonisation]] and the [[EU Constitution]]. The Irish electorate [[Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2008 (Ireland)|declined to ratify]] the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] in 2008. A second referendum in October 2009 passed the bill, allowing the treaty to be ratified. Before it was ratified Ireland required legal guarantees on issues such as the right of Ireland to remain militarily neutral (and not engage in any kind of \"European army\"), the right of the state to maintain its low levels of corporation tax and that the treaty would not change the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] making [[abortion]] illegal ([[Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|since deleted]]).

Although the King's position was removed from the Constitution in 1936, but included in the [[External Relations Act 1936]] itself, a republic was only formally declared from 18 April 1949 when the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]] came into effect. \n\nUnder the rules for membership at the time, a republic could not be a member state of the Commonwealth. Only a Dominion could be a British Commonwealth member state, along with [[King George VI]] as their head of state.\n\nThis was changed a week later with the adoption of the [[London Declaration]], then India became the first [[Commonwealth republic]] on 26 January 1950. King George VI became the first [[Head of the Commonwealth]] as a result.\n\nSince 1998, some people in Ireland have advocated joining the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], most notably [[Éamon Ó Cuív]], [[Frank Feighan]], and [[Mary Kenny]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://breakingnews.iol.ie/news/?c=ireland&jp=mhkfauqlkfcw|title=More calls for Govt to rejoin Commonwealth|date=15 May 2007|website=Ireland Online News|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112213431/http://breakingnews.iol.ie/news/?c=ireland&jp=mhkfauqlkfcw|archive-date=12 January 2008|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/readme/should-ireland-rejoin-the-commonwealth-2837823-Jun2016/|title=Is it now time for Ireland to consider rejoining the Commonwealth?|last=Feighan|first=Frank|website=TheJournal.ie|date=21 June 2016|access-date=2019-11-20|archive-date=27 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127230013/https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/should-ireland-rejoin-the-commonwealth-2837823-Jun2016/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==International organisations==\nIreland is a member of or otherwise participates in the following international organisations:<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/ireland/ CIA&nbsp;– The World Factbook&nbsp;– Ireland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109164445/https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/ireland/ |date=9 January 2021 }}&nbsp;— [[CIA World Factbook]] entry.
