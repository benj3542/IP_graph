the Cold War and the ideology of [[communism]]. The establishment of modern Sino-African relations dates back to the late 1950s when China signed the first official bilateral trade agreement with Algeria, Egypt, Guinea, Somalia, Morocco and Sudan. Zhou Enlai made a ten-country tour to Africa between December 1963 and January 1964. Zhou Enlai visited Ghana and established close relations with [[Kwame Nkrumah]], a leader who strived for a united Africa.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Savage|first1=Joel|title=The Confused Moments of Nkrumah in China After The Coup|work=modernghana.com|url=https://www.modernghana.com/news/876767/the-confused-moments-of-nkrumah-in-china-after-the-coup.html|url-status=live|access-date=7 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190427041712/https://www.modernghana.com/news/876767/the-confused-moments-of-nkrumah-in-china-after-the-coup.html|archive-date=27 April 2019}}</ref> Relations at that time were often reflective of Chinese foreign policy in general: China \"began to cultivate ties and offer[...] economic, technical and military support to African countries and liberation movements in an effort to encourage [[wars of national liberation]] and revolution as part of an international united front against both superpower\".<ref>Muekalia 2004, p.6</ref> In 1965 [[Ben Bella]] was overthrown in Algeria, with a result that the Soviets gained influence in North Africa and the Middle East. Kwame Nkrumah, the most prominent leader of sub-Saharan Africa, was deposed while on a trip to China in early 1966.  The new rulers shifted Ghana to the West's side of the Cold War.<ref>Odd Arne Westad, ''The Global Cold War'' (2005) p 107.</ref>\n\nChina originally had close ties with the [[apartheid|anti-apartheid]] and [[liberation movement]], [[African National Congress]] (ANC), in [[South Africa]], but as China's relations with the [[Soviet Union]] worsened and the ANC moved closer to the Soviet Union, China shifted away from the ANC towards the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania|Pan-Africanist Congress]].<ref>Taylor 2000, p. 93</ref> In the 1960s and 1970s, Beijing's interest centered on building ideological solidarity. China adopted several principles, among them supporting the independence of African countries while investing in infrastructure projects. The [[Somali Democratic Republic]] established good relations with the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War era. When Somalia sought to create a [[Greater Somalia]], it [[Ogaden War|declared war]] on [[Ethiopia]], with the aid of the Soviet Union, Somalia took [[Ogaden]] in three months, but the Soviet Union shifted its support from Somalia to Ethiopia, and Ethiopia retook the Ogaden region. This angered [[Siad Barre]], and expelled all Soviet advisors and citizens from Somalia, but Somalia maintained good relations with China, which [[Sino-Soviet split|segregated]] with the traditional [[Marxism–Leninism|Soviet Communism]]. China and [[Zaire]] shared a common goal in Central Africa, namely doing everything in their power to halt Soviet gains in the area. Accordingly, both Zaire and China covertly funneled aid to the [[FNLA]] (and later, [[UNITA]]) in order to prevent the [[MPLA]], who were supported and augmented by [[Cuba]], from coming to power. During the Cold War, a few smaller nations also entered in alliances with China, such as [[Burundi]] under [[Michel Micombero]].\n\nThe [[political status of Taiwan]] has been a key political issue for the People's Republic of [[China]] (PRC). In 1971, the support of African nations was crucial in the PRC joining the United Nations (UN), taking over the seat of the ROC on Taiwan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eg.china-embassy.org/eng/zagx/t274327.htm|title=From \"brothers\" to \"partners\": China, Africa building strategic ties|access-date=14 March 2009|work=Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the Arab Republic of Egypt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508171410/http://eg.china-embassy.org/eng/zagx/t274327.htm|archive-date=8 May 2013}}</ref> However, while many African countries such as [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]] and [[Zambia]] have stressed their support to the PRC's one-China policy, [[Eswatini]] maintains relations with [[Taipei]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/22427|title=China woos Taiwan's African friends|access-date=14 March 2009|work=afrol.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314083923/http://www.afrol.com/articles/22427|archive-date=14 March 2012}}</ref> For the quest of a permanent [[UN Security Council]] seat for Africa, Nigeria, the most populous African country, relies on Chinese support while Egypt looks to U.S. backing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Africa and the UN Security Council Permanent Seats|url=http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/aumonitor/27913|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508111435/http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/aumonitor/27913|archive-date=8 May 2013|access-date=14 March 2009|work=[[Pambazuka News]]}}</ref>\n\nIn its relations with African countries, China has shown a willingness to grant diplomatic audiences at the highest levels to even delegations from the smaller African countries.<ref name=\":102\"/>{{Rp|page=107}}\n\n====Economic relations====\n{{Main|Africa–China economic relations}}\n\n[[File:Belt and Road Initiative participant map.svg|thumb|Countries which signed cooperation documents related to the [[Belt and Road Initiative]]]]\nIn 1980, the total Sino-African trade volume was US$1 billion.
