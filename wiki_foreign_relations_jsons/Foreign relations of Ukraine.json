The '''foreign relations of Ukraine''' are guided by a number of key priorities outlined in the [[foreign policy of Ukraine]].\n\n==Western relations==\n[[Ukraine]] considers Euro-Atlantic integration its primary foreign policy objective, but in practice balances its relationship with Europe and the United States while attempting to sever its considerable ties to Russia. The [[European Union]]'s Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) with Ukraine went into force on March 1, 1998. The European Union (EU) has encouraged Ukraine to implement the PCA fully before discussions begin on an association agreement. The EU Common Strategy toward Ukraine, issued at the EU Summit in December 1999 in [[Helsinki]], recognizes Ukraine's long-term aspirations but does not discuss association.<ref name=\":3\">[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/67901/ Ukraine makes it official: Nation will abandon plans to join NATO], [[Kyiv Post]] (May 28, 2010)</ref>\n\nOn January 31, 1992, Ukraine joined the then-Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (now the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]]—OSCE), and on March 10, 1992, it became a member of the [[North Atlantic Cooperation Council]]. Ukraine also has a close relationship with [[NATO]] and has declared interest in eventual membership. It is the most active member of the [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP). Former President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] indicated that he supports Ukraine joining the EU in the future.
