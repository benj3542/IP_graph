The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ethiopia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] oversees foreign relations and diplomatic missions of the country.\n\nEthiopia is one of few early African countries admitted to the League of Nations, becoming a member on 28 September 1923, and was one of the founding members of the United Nations. During the Scramble for Africa, Ethiopia had maintained its full sovereignty over European colonial power and fought the First Italo-Ethiopian War in 1895–96. However, the League did not protect in accord with the envisaged \"collective security\" of the country, resulted Italy's occupation of Ethiopia for 5 years (1936–1941).\n\nFrom 1950s, Ethiopia participated to UN peacekeeping missions such as in Korean War and Congo Crisis. Virtually, Ethiopia maintains diplomatic relations to most countries, and is non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.\n\n==History==\n===Antiquity===\n====Land of Punt====\n[[Land of Punt|Punt]] (2500 BCE – 980 BCE) was predominantly a trading centre dominated by [[Ancient Egypt]] to [[Horn of Africa]]. Trading commodities includes exports of Egypt; one of the most essential was [[incense]], which was mainly used for religious rituals for [[embalming]] corpse. Other were [[ivory]], [[spices]], [[Hide (skin)|hides]] and exotic animals that convey route to coast of Ethiopia, thus Ethiopia has been an integral part of Punt. Egyptian expedition to southeastern African region was generally commenced in the second millennium BC, after stabilizing relations with kingdoms of today's [[Sudan]], the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], [[Napata]] and [[Meroë]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Henze |first=Paul B. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySgCTIplVQ8C&q=addis+ababa+history+zewditu |title=Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia |date=2000 |publisher=Hurst & Company |isbn=978-1-85065-522-0 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n====South Arabia====\n\n[[File:Bab el Mandeb NAS-AR description.png|thumb|[[NASA]] capture of Arabic description of strait [[Bab el Mandeb]]. It is known for passage for South Arabian migration.]]\nSome theorists hypothesized Ancient South Arabian people migrated [[Recent African origin of modern humans|out of Africa]] to the strait [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] when its sea level decreased to current status. When their civilization came to appear from 4th millennium BC, onward [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Persian Gulf]], adaptation of Semitic language was from end of [[Mediterranean]], though they used Canaanite alphabet developed from Syria or Palestine during second millennium BC. Apparently, these languages similarity compared to Hebrew and Phoenician alphabets, even though lacked scholarly consensus. By 500 BC, it was widely spoken such as the [[Ge'ez language]].{{sfn|Henze|2000|p=19}}\n\nWriting system through [[inscription]] on stone often detailed historical rival kingdoms in the region, most notability the Saba, Qataban, Himyar, [[Hadhramaut]], [[Ma'in]] and others. In 1959, American archeologists collected numerous artifacts and body of inscriptions in the area, belonging to [[primary source]]s. The inscription not only detailed about South Arabia, but also the early [[History of Ethiopia|Ethiopian history]] associated with Kingdom of Aksum and its rulers.{{sfn|Henze|2000|p=20}}\n\n====Kingdom of Aksum====\n[[File:Periplous of the Erythraean Sea.svg|thumb|Map of [[Eastern Hemisphere]] in the first century featuring trade route of Aksum with the rest powerful states]] \nThe [[Kingdom of Aksum]] has been a great power in classic Africa; once it has been referenced by Persian prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] in the 3rd century and Greco-Roman trading guide ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' in first century. Axum maintained well-defined foreign relations with powerful realms in the era. According to Stuart Munro-Hay witness, the Aksumite had several account of ambassadors that had delegation with neighboring powers. Occasionally, Aksumite contact with foreign powers also attested by archaeological or scarce finds.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |title=Foreign Relations – Addis Herald |url=https://www.addisherald.com/3-6-foreign-relations/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220404175707/https://www.addisherald.com/3-6-foreign-relations/#:~:text=Aksum%20had%20diplomatic%20and%20commercial,the%20purpose%20of%20their%20missions. |archive-date=4 April 2022 |access-date=2022-04-04 |website=Addis Herald |language=en-US |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Egypt====\nAksumite relations with pre-Roman Egypt was ostensibly uncertain. However, it was considered that Aksumite contact were also existed during the fall of [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] with [[Cleopatra]] death in 30 BC. Few artifacts were uncovered from Egypt such as cippus of Horus given to Bruce, and illustrated by him, and a few amulet figurines of blue faience<ref name=\":2\" /> or cornaline<ref name=\":2\" /> found at various sites of Ethiopia. Other include the double-uraeus, perhaps brought from [[Meroë]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAnother discoveries are an inscription of [[Ptolemy III]] copied by Kosmas at [[Adulis]] and ankh'-sign engraved on one of the stelae. During King [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]]'s reign, he expedited to the Nile after [[Meroë]] was entirely sacked. After its successor [[Noba]] emerged, it behaved badly to consign Aksumite ambassadors punished with military expedition. An aggressive mistreatment was objected by tribes such as the [[Mangurto]], the [[Nara people|Barya]], and the [[Khasa kingdom|Khasa]] by asking support, either regarded Aksum would an aide of Noba or possibly a suzerain. Ezana's expedition also attacked Kasu, the remnants of Meroitic state. Nuba, Kasu, and Beja were integral to Ezana's kingdom. Meroitic artifacts have been found in Ethiopian location [[Dar'a|Addi Galamo]] (Atse Dera) such as bronze bowls, which was brought from Roman Egypt. It was possibly made up of diorite thumb-ring found by the BIEA expedition at Aksum, and corna line amulet of Harpocrates with typical double-uraeus of the Meroites.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n====South Arabia====\nSaba, [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyar]] and Hadhramawit kingdom commonly known as South Arabian states—had special relations with Ethiopia. Culturally, linguistically, and socially, Aksumite civilization completely inspired by those overseas. While Aksumite intervention to states generally uncertain, it was viable to have a military expedition beginning in 3rd century. During the period of [[GDRT]] and [[Adhebah]] reign, (’DBH), Aksumite commenced a military treaty with Saba and then with Hadhramawit in the first half of third century.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nDuring Adhebah period, Shamir called Himyar prince Dhu-Raydan sent military aid from Aksum. Later, Aksumite king adopted nominally \"king of Saba and Himyar\", asserting suzerainty. Foreign contact also continued during the fifth and early sixth centuries between the two sides of Red Sea. Byzantine scholar [[Procopius]] told the voyage of crossing Red Sea for five days and nights and that \"the harbor of the Homeritae from which they are accustomed to putting to sea is called Boulikas\", presumably somewhere near Mukha, and \" at the end of the sail across the sea they always put in at the harbor of the Adulitae\" at the reign of King Kaleb.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nArabian titles were experienced in South Arabia during Kaleb's reign; after his viceroy deposed by Jewish Himyar king Yusuf Asar, Yemen was no longer requisite to Aksum. The event led Aksumite to decline its dominion. An inscription dated to 543 AD mentioned that the new king named Abraha dealing with the restoration of great dam at Marib, and mentioned embassies from various foreign countries such as Aksum, Rome, Persia and various Arab groups. Procopius noted that Abreha was subordinated by Kaleb, a period which unbeknownst to Abreha regaining the kingdom reputations and he received little damage.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{see also|Ethiopian–Adal War|Prester John}}\n[[File:Prester John.jpg|thumb|250px|\"''Preste''\" as the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]], enthroned on a map of East Africa.

Among other Jesuit, Spanish Jesuit Pedro Paez had favorable relations to the Emperors of Ethiopia like [[Za Dengel]] and [[Susenyos I]], the latter promulgated that Roman Catholicism state administrative to the Empire in 1622 on behalf of [[Orthodox Tewahedo]] Church, resulted in grave conflict for the years.\n\nThe reign of Emperor [[Fasilides]] in 1632 arranged this status by restoring Orthodox Tewahedo state leadership and expelled Jesuits from his land. After founding Gondar in 1636, Ethiopia then prospered again with the beginning of \"[[Gondarine period]]\" characterized as relatively peaceful governance. However, few [[Franciscan]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] friars said to be lived during the 18th century such as Franciscan Giuseppe Maria di Gerusalemme, Remedius Prutky (who left credible records to the city).\n\nArchitecture of this period was slightly influenced by the remnant Jesuits, but also the presence of Arab, Indians (brought by the Jesuits) as well as Turkish in Ottoman occupied [[Habesh Eyalet|northern area]] had involvement.
