"{{Short description|none}} <!-- \"none\" is preferred when the title is sufficiently descriptive; see [[WP:SDNONE]] -->\n{{Politics of Bahrain}}[[Bahrain]] plays a modest, moderating role in regional politics and adheres to the views of the [[Arab League]] on [[Middle East]] peace and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] rights. Since achieving independence in 1971, Bahrain has maintained friendly relations with most of its neighbours and with the world community. It generally pursues a policy of close consultation with neighbouring states and works to narrow areas of disagreement.\n\nBahrain is a member of the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf]] (GCC), established on May 26, 1981, with five other Arab Gulf states. The country has fully complied with steps taken by the GCC to coordinate economic development and defense and security planning. In December 1994, it concurred with the GCC decision to drop secondary and tertiary boycotts against [[Israel]]. In many instances, it has established special bilateral trade agreements.\n\nBahrain has been a member of [[The Forum of Small States (FOSS)]] since the group's founding in 1992.<ref name=\"singaporebook\">{{Cite book|title=50 Years of Singapore and the United Nations |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-4713-03-0 |year=2015 }}access-date=28 March 2024</ref>\n\nBahrain's current Minister of Foreign Affairs is [[Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Minister of Foreign Affairs|url=https://www.mofa.gov.bh/Ministry/OrganizationalStructure/MinisterofFA/tabid/115/language/en-US/Default.aspx|access-date=2021-10-29|website=www.mofa.gov.bh|language=en-US|archive-date=2021-10-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211029085207/https://www.mofa.gov.bh/Ministry/OrganizationalStructure/MinisterofFA/tabid/115/language/en-US/Default.aspx|url-status=dead}}</ref> Its previous foreign minister was [[Khalid ibn Ahmad Al Khalifah|Sheikh Khaled bin Ahmed Al Khalifa]], a career diplomat.

Al Baharna was formerly a leading member of Al Wefaq.{{citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nIn June 2006, Bahrain was elected head of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], and used the honour to appoint [[Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa|Haya bint Rashid Al Khalifa]] as the Assembly's president, making her the first Middle East woman and only the third woman in history to take over the post. Sheikha Haya is a leading Bahraini lawyer and women's rights advocate who took over the post at a time of change for the world body. UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] said of her, \"I met her yesterday and I found her quite impressive.

In July 1995 the [[U.S. 5th Fleet]] was established in the [[Persian Gulf]] with its headquarters at NSA Bahrain in [[Manama]]. In 2003, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W.

However, with the decline of Iraq as a regional powerbroker, Bahrain has begun taking steps to improve relations with Iran and increase regional harmony.

The conference, attended by Arab and Indian academics, UN officials and diplomats discussed the Gandhi’s teaching of non-violence, austerity and spiritualism with particular reference to the Arab world today. Among the keynote speakers was leading liberal academic, Dr Abdulla Al Madani, who emphasised Gandhi’s moral vision: \"Had he resorted to kidnapping, suicide-bombings, beheadings, or other barbarian means, his memory would not have remained rooted in the world's conscience. Believing that the credibility of one's action lay in setting a personal example, Gandhi began with himself. He quit his legal practice, gave up wearing Western-style clothing, and embraced a humble lifestyle by making his own clothes and living on a simple vegetarian diet. This, of course, differs from the practice of leaders of some Arab resistance movements, who urge their followers to boycott the West while savouring the Western lifestyle, products, and technology.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=195620&Sn=BNEW&IssueID=30197|title=Gulf Daily News » Local News » Gandhi's ideals 'vital for world'|access-date=21 February 2015}}{{Dead link|date=June 2025 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Relations with Thailand and the Hakeem al-Araibi incident==\n\n{{main|Hakeem al-Araibi}}\nBahrain's foreign relations were put under strain and its [[Human rights in Bahrain|human rights record]] under the spotlight when in November 2018 Bahraini footballer [[Hakeem al-Araibi]], who had been sentenced [[Trial in absentia|in absentia]] by Bahrain to 10 years in prison for vandalising a police station in 2013, was arrested upon arrival in [[Thailand]] with his wife for their honeymoon.
