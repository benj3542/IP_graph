the most significant ancient cultures in the Americas. Both countries have expressed solidarity over the need to defend the recovery of cultural and archaeological heritage in the form of artifacts that have been illegally stolen from Peru and Mexico and which are to this date, illegally or legitimately kept in foreign locations. Peru's President [[Alan García]] and Mexico's [[Felipe Calderón]] signed a joint declaration in April 2011 aimed at deepening the two countries' friendship, cooperation, integration, trade, investments and the permanent fight against poverty and organized crime. The two countries aim to achieve a new model of integration within Latin America, and to represent a positive, realistic, and active example of integration amongst two \"brotherly\" nations. Both nations will retain consular relations. On 3 November 2025, the Peruvian government severed relations with Mexico for offering former Prime Minister [[Betssy Chávez]] asylum inside the Mexican Embassy in Lima.\n\n* Mexico has a consular section in [[Lima]].<ref>[https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/peru/ Embassy of Mexico in Peru]</ref>\n* Peru has a consular section in Mexico City.<ref>[https://www.gob.pe/embajada-del-peru-en-mexico Embassy of Peru in Mexico]</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Saint Kitts and Nevis}}||<!--Date started-->July 31, 1990||See [[Mexico–Saint Kitts and Nevis relations]]\n\n* Mexico is accredited to Saint Kitts an Nevis from its embassy in Castries, Saint Lucia and maintains an honorary consulate in [[Basseterre]].<ref name=Castries />\n* Saint Kitts and Nevis is accredited to Mexico from its embassy in Washington, D.C., United States.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Saint Lucia}}||<!--Date started-->May 17, 1979||See [[Mexico–Saint Lucia relations]]\n\n* Mexico has an embassy in Castries.<ref name=Castries />\n* Saint Lucia is accredited to Mexico from its embassy in Washington, D.C., United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embassyofstlucia.org/|title=Home|website=embassyofsaintlucia|accessdate=June 20, 2023|archive-date=July 20, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220720033434/https://www.embassyofstlucia.org/|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines}}||<!--Date started-->July 31, 1990||See [[Mexico–Saint Vincent and the Grenadines relations]]\n\n* Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is accredited to Mexico from its embassy in Washington, D.C., United States.\n* Mexico is accredited to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines from its embassy in Castries, Saint Lucia and maintains an honorary consulate in [[Kingstown]].<ref name=Castries />\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Suriname}}||<!--Date started-->1975||See [[Mexico–Suriname relations]]\n\n* Mexico is accredited to Suriname from its embassy in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago.<ref name=Trinidad />\n* Suriname is accredited to Mexico from its embassy in Washington, D.C., United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://surinameembassy.org/ |title=Embassy of the Republic of Suriname, Washington, D.C. |website=Surinameembassy.org |access-date=September 18, 2016 |archive-date=September 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918105735/http://surinameembassy.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Trinidad and Tobago}}||<!--Date started-->April 30, 1966||See [[Mexico–Trinidad and Tobago relations]]\n\n* Mexico has an embassy in [[Port of Spain]].<ref name=Trinidad />\n* Trinidad and Tobago is accredited to Mexico from its embassy in Washington, D.C., United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreign.gov.tt/missions-consuls/tt-missions-abroad/diplomatic-missions/embassy-washington-dc-us/|title=Embassy in Washington D.C., U.S.A.|website=Ministry of Foreign and CARICOM Affairs|accessdate=June 20, 2023|archive-date=August 5, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200805140055/https://foreign.gov.tt/missions-consuls/tt-missions-abroad/diplomatic-missions/embassy-washington-dc-us/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|United States}}||<!--Date started-->1821||See [[Mexico–United States relations]]\n\n[[File:President Joe Biden hosted the 2021 North American Leaders' Summit (3).jpg|thumb|U.S. President Biden and Mexican President [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]], November 2021.]]\n\nWhen Mexico [[Independence of Mexico|gained its independence]] from Spain in 1821, the United States was the first country to recognize it.<ref>El Colegio de México (2007), p. 541.</ref> On December 12, 1822, the then-[[United States Secretary of State]] [[John Quincy Adams]] introduced José Manuel Zozoya, the first Mexican representative, to the then-U.S. president [[James Monroe]] in the [[White House]].

historical ties established over {{rounddown|{{age|format=raw|1565|1|1}}|-1}} years ago. Their common history dates back to the time when both countries were part of [[New Spain]]. Mexican money financed the expedition known as [[Miguel López de Legazpi|Legazpi exploration]], under the command of [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II of Spain]]. During the Mexican administration of the Philippines, other than [[Miguel López de Legazpi|General Legazpi]], all of the governor-generals were born in Mexico. Due to the grand exchange with the Philippines in those days, many cultural traits were adopted by one another, with Mexicans remaining in the Philippines, and Filipinos establishing in Mexico, particularly the central west coast, near the port town of [[Acapulco]]. Many [[Nahuatl]] words were adopted and popularized in the Philippines, such as ''Tianggui'' (market fair) and ''Zapote'' (a fruit).\nAfter the colonial period, the first official contacts of Mexico with the Philippines were established in 1842, when a Mexican Representation was opened in Manila. With the assignment of Mexican Diplomat Evaristo Butler Hernandez in the Philippines in 1878.\nThe Independence of the Philippines brought forth a new era of relations between these countries. Mexico dispatched an envoy to participate in the festivities to celebrate the birth of the [[Southeast Asian]] nation. Diplomatic ties between both countries were formalized on April 14, 1953. The year of 1964 was decreed the \"Year of Philippine-Mexican Friendship\" to celebrate the Fourth Centennial of the Expedition of Miguel López de Legazpi. In modern day, the conquest of the Philippines is seen as a Spanish initiative, while Mexico is viewed as a country of historical link and friendship, and several groups intend on strengthening the bond between the two countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portal.sre.gob.mx/filipinaseng/index.php?option%3Ddisplaypage%26Itemid%3D59%26op%3Dpage%26SubMenu%3D |title=Embassy of Mexico in Philippines
