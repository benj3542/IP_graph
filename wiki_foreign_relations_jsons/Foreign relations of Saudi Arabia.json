The country plays a prominent role in the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]], and in 2005 joined the [[World Trade Organization]].\n\nAccording to a [[UCLA]] professor [[James L. Gelvin]], Saudi Arabia recently has become much more active in terms of foreign and security policy because of the [[Arab Spring]], the policies of the [[Obama administration]] and the mid-2010s collapse of [[oil price]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/why-is-saudi-arabia-suddenly-so-paranoid-85784|title=Why is Saudi Arabia suddenly so paranoid?|first=James L.|last=Gelvin|date=20 October 2017 |access-date=26 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAfter [[World War II]] (1939–1945) and during the [[Cold War]] (1945–1992), Saudi Arabia maintained an anti-[[Communist]], anti-secular [[Arab nationalist|Arab-nationalist]] policy, often working with the leading [[anti-communist]] power, the United States.  Following the [[1973 oil crisis]], when Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil exporters embargoed the United States and its allies for their support of Israel, oil revenues increased dramatically, and the Kingdom worked to become the leading Islamic state, spending generously to advance Islam and particularly its conservative school (known as [[Wahhabism]]).  Supporters see this as having purified and unified the Islamic faith; other commentators claim it has eroded regional Islamic cultures. (Examples of the acculturizing effect of Saudi aid can be seen among the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] and the [[Aceh]]nese in [[Indonesia]], as well as among the people of the [[Maldives]].<ref>Ricklefs, M.C.

It was not just the Afghan Mujahideen who benefited, fatefully as we well know, from Saudi largesse, but America's proxy fighters on other cold-war fronts, from Angola to Central America to the Horn of Africa. Less dramatically but perhaps more crucially, the kingdom also bled the Soviet Union by keeping oil prices down throughout the 1980s, just when the Russians were desperate to sell energy in order to keep up with huge hikes in American military spending. In periods of shortage during the past ten years, such as during the Iraq wars and Venezuela's 2002 oil strike, the Saudis have cranked up production to keep prices stable.}}</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]]'s stroke in 1995, [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]], then [[Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia|Crown Prince]], assumed responsibility for foreign policy. A marked change in U.S.-Saudi relations occurred, as Abdullah sought to put distance between his policies and the unpopular pro-Western policies of King Fahd. Abdullah took a more independent line from the US and concentrated on improving regional relations, particularly with Iran. Several long-standing border disputes were resolved, including significantly reshaping the Saudi border with [[Yemen]]. The new approach resulted in increasingly strained relations with the US.<ref name=\"Encyclopædia Britannica Online: Saudi Arabia\" /> Despite this, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia remained close. In 1998 Abdullah paid a state visit to Washington and met with U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]].\n\nIn 2003 Abdullah's new policy was reflected in the Saudi government's refusal to support or to participate in the U.S.-led [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]]. Some US critics{{which|date=February 2021}} saw this as an attempt by the [[Saudi royal family]] to placate the kingdom's Islamist radicals. That same year Saudi and U.S. government officials agreed to [[United States withdrawal from Saudi Arabia|the withdrawal of all U.S. military forces]] from Saudi soil. After ascending the throne, King Abdullah ({{reign | 2005 | 2015}}) followed a more activist foreign policy and continued to push-back on US policies which were unpopular in Saudi Arabia (for example, refusing to provide material assistance to support the new Iraqi government).<ref name=\"Encyclopædia Britannica Online: Saudi Arabia\"/><ref name=\"Foreign Policy\">[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/06/28/abdullahs_no_reformer \"Abdullah's no reformer\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030083104/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/06/28/abdullahs_no_reformer |date=30 October 2012 }} ''Foreign Policy'', 28 June 2010</ref> However, increasingly, in common with the US, fear and mistrust of Iran became a significant factor in Saudi policy.

This agreement formed the basis of what grew into a longstanding security relationship. The United States is one of Saudi Arabia's largest trading partners and closest allies and has had full diplomatic relations since 1933 and they remain strong today.

Although Saudi Arabia and Iran are Muslim majority nations, their relationship is fraught with tension, suspicion and hostility. Various attempts have been made to improve the relationship, though none have had lasting success. Both Saudi Arabia and Iran have aspirations for Islamic leadership and both the countries possess a different vision of regional order. Iran, which after the Islamic Revolution strictly followed an anti-US policy, always deemed Saudi Arabia as an agent of the US in the Persian Gulf region that speaks for US interests. Saudi Arabia's concerns about Iran on the other side are mainly associated with its plans of expanding influence to other parts of the [[Persian Gulf]] region, especially in post-Saddam Iraq, and the quest to build its own nuclear arsenal.<ref name=\"rand\">[http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2009/RAND-MG840.pdf \"Saudi-Iranian Relations Since the Fall of Saddam: Rivalry, Cooperation and Implication for US Policy\"]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [[Frederic Wehrey]] et al, RAND, National Security Research Division, 2009.</ref>\n\nDifferences in political ideologies and governance also divided both the countries. For Iran, it is said that there is no place for monarchical regimes in Islam, like the ones seen in Saudi Arabia and also in some other Arab countries. Energy difference is a third source of tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

It calls for Israel's withdrawal from territory occupied in June 1967 in order to obtain peace with the Arab states; then-Crown Prince Abdullah extended a multilateral peace proposal based on withdrawal in 2002.  At that time, Israel did not respond to the offer.
