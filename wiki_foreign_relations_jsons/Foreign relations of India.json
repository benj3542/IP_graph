When India gained independence in 1947, few Indians had experience in making or conducting foreign policy. However, the country's oldest political party, the [[Indian National Congress]], had established a small foreign department in 1925 to make overseas contacts and to publicise its independence struggle. From the late 1920s on, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], who had a long-standing interest in world affairs among independence leaders, formulated the Congress's stance on international issues in tandem with [[V. K. Krishna Menon]]; after 1947, they articulated India's worldview as Prime Minister and ''de facto'' Foreign Minister.\n\nIndia's international influence varied over the years after independence. Indian prestige and moral authority were high in the 1950s and facilitated the acquisition of developmental assistance from both East and West. Although the prestige stemmed from India's nonaligned stance, and in particular the position it placed Indian diplomats, like Menon, to mediate or conciliate in others' disputes, the nation was unable to prevent Cold War politics from becoming intertwined with interstate relations in South Asia.  On the intensely debated Kashmir issue with Pakistan, India lost credibility by rejecting United Nations' calls for a plebiscite in the disputed area.<ref>Itty Abraham, \"From Bandung to NAM: Non-alignment and Indian foreign policy, 1947–65.\" ''Commonwealth & Comparative Politics'' 46.2 (2008): 195–219.</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, India's international position among developed and developing countries faded during wars with China and Pakistan, disputes with other countries in South Asia, and India's attempt to match Pakistan's support from the United States and China by signing the [[Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation]] in August 1971. Although India obtained substantial Soviet military and economic aid, which helped to strengthen the nation, India's influence was undercut regionally and internationally by the perception that its [[Indo–Russia relations#India and the Soviet Union|friendship with the Soviet Union]] prevented a more forthright condemnation of the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. In the late 1980s, India improved relations with the United States, other developed countries, and China while continuing close ties with the Soviet Union. Relations with its South Asian neighbours, especially Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal, occupied much of the energies of the Ministry of External Affairs.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/india/122.htm India – Foreign Relations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328205904/http://countrystudies.us/india/122.htm |date=28 March 2016 }}.

By the 1970s, the Office of the Prime Minister had become the de facto coordinator and supra-ministry of the Indian government. The enhanced role of the office strengthened the prime minister's control over foreign policymaking at the expense of the Ministry of External Affairs. Advisers in the office provided channels of information and policy recommendations in addition to those offered by the Ministry of External Affairs. A subordinate part of the office—the [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (RAW)—functioned in ways that significantly expanded the information available to the prime minister and his advisers. The RAW gathered intelligence, provided intelligence analysis to the Office of the Prime Minister, and conducted covert operations abroad.\n\nThe prime minister's control and reliance on personal advisers in the Office of the Prime Minister was particularly strong under the tenures of [[Indira Gandhi]] (1966–77 and 1980–84) and her son, Rajiv (1984–89), who succeeded her, and weaker during the periods of coalition governments.

During the cold war, India's relations with its Southeast Asian neighbours were not strong. After the end of the cold war, the government of India particularly realised the importance of redressing this imbalance in India's foreign policy. Consequently, the Narsimha Rao government in the early 1990s unveiled the look east policy. Initially, it focused on renewing political and economic contacts with the countries of East and South-East Asia.\n[[File:The Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh at the opening ceremony of third Summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), at Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar on March 04, 2014 (1).jpg|thumb|The [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]], [[Manmohan Singh|Dr. Manmohan Singh]] at the opening ceremony of third Summit of the [[Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation|Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC)]], at [[Naypyidaw|Nay Pyi Taw]], [[Myanmar]] on 4 March 2014 ]]\nAt present,{{when|date=August 2020}} under the [[Look East policy (India)|Look East Policy]], the Government of India is giving special emphasis on the economic development of the backward northeastern region of India taking advantage of a huge market of ASEAN as well as of the energy resources available in some of the member countries of ASEAN like Burma.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/details.asp?id=jan1907\\edit2|publisher=Assam Tribune|title=Assam Tribune articles}} {{Dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> The look-east policy was launched in 1991 just after the end of the cold war, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. After the start of liberalisation, it was a very strategic policy decision taken by the government in foreign policy. To quote Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \"it was also a strategic shift in India's vision of the world and India's place in the evolving global economy\".\n\nThe policy was given an initial thrust with the then Prime Minister Narasimha Rao visiting China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and Singapore and India becoming an important dialogue partner with ASEAN in 1992. Since the beginning of this century, India has given a big push to this policy by becoming a summit-level partner of ASEAN (2002) and getting involved in some regional initiatives such as the [[Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation|BIMSTEC]] and the Ganga–Mekong Cooperation and now becoming a member of the [[East Asia Summit|East Asia Summit (EAS)]] in December 2005.<ref name=\"indianmba.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.indianmba.com/Occasional_Papers/OP104/op104.html |title=India's Look-East Policy |publisher=Indianmba.com |access-date=21 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429113146/http://www.indianmba.com/Occasional_Papers/OP104/op104.html |archive-date=29 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Ties with Western countries ===\nSince the dissolution of the Soviet Union, India has forged a closer partnership with Western powers. In the 1990s, India's economic problems and the demise of the bipolar world political system forced India to reassess its foreign policy and adjust its foreign relations. Previous policies proved inadequate to cope with the serious domestic and international problems facing India. The end of the Cold War gutted the core meaning of nonalignment and left Indian foreign policy without significant direction. The hard, pragmatic considerations of the early 1990s were still viewed within the nonaligned framework of the past, but the disintegration of the Soviet Union removed much of India's international leverage, for which relations with Russia and the other post-Soviet states could not compensate. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, India improved its relations with the United States, Canada, France, Japan, and Germany. In 1992, India established formal diplomatic relations with Israel and this relationship grew during the tenures of the [[National Democratic Alliance|National Democratic Alliance (NDA)]] government and the subsequent [[United Progressive Alliance|United Progressive Alliance (UPA)]] governments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indembassy.co.il/India-Israel%20Bilateral%20relations.htm |title=Embassy of India – India-Israel Bilateral relations |publisher=Indembassy.co.il |access-date=21 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310185904/http://www.indembassy.co.il/India-Israel%20Bilateral%20relations.htm |archive-date=10 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1990s, India attracted the world's attention to Pakistan-backed [[terrorism in Kashmir]]. The [[Kargil War]] resulted in a major diplomatic victory for India. The United States and European Union recognised the fact that the Pakistani military had illegally infiltrated Indian territory and pressured Pakistan to withdraw from Kargil. Several anti-India militant groups based in Pakistan were labelled as [[List of designated terrorist groups|terrorist groups]] by the United States and [[European Union]].\n\nIn 1998, India tested nuclear weapons for the second time (see [[Pokhran-II]]) which resulted in several US, Japanese and European sanctions on India. India's then defence minister, [[George Fernandes]], said that India's [[India and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear programme]] was necessary as it provided a deterrence to potential Chinese nuclear threat. Most of the sanctions imposed on India were removed by 2001.<ref>[http://www.expressindia.com/news/fe/daily/19990511/fex10031.html Beyond Pokharan II] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929065309/http://www.expressindia.com/news/fe/daily/19990511/fex10031.html |date=29 September 2012 }}.

In 2004, bilateral trade between India and Canada was at about C$2.45 billion. However, the botched handling of the [[Air India Flight 182|Air India investigation]] and the case, in general, suffered a setback to Indo-Canadian relations.

After the conclusion of CEPA, Canada and India must define the areas for their partnership which will depend on their ability to convert common interests into common action and respond effectively for steady cooperation. For example, during \"pull-aside\" meetings between Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] and [[Stephen Harper]] at the G-20 summit in Mexico in June 2012, and an earlier meeting in Toronto between External Affairs Minister S.

The US provided support to India in 1962 during its war with China. For most of the [[Cold War]], the USA tended to have warmer relations with Pakistan, primarily as a way to contain Soviet-friendly India and to use Pakistan to back the Afghan [[Mujahideen]] against the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet occupation of Afghanistan]]. An [[Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation]], signed in 1971, also positioned India against the USA.\n\nAfter the [[Sino-Indian War]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], India made considerable changes to its foreign policy. It developed a close relationship with the Soviet Union and started receiving massive military equipment and financial assistance from the USSR. This harmed the Indo-US relationship. The United States saw Pakistan as a counterweight to pro-Soviet India and started giving the former military assistance. This created an atmosphere of suspicion between India and the US. The Indo-US relationship suffered a considerable setback when [[Soviet–Afghan War|the Soviets took over Afghanistan]] and India overtly supported the Soviet Union.\n\nRelations between India and the United States came to an all-time low during the early 1970s.

Most of the sanctions imposed on India were removed by 2001. India has categorically stated that it will never use weapons first but will defend itself if attacked.\n\nThe economic sanctions imposed by the United States in response to India's nuclear tests in May 1998 appeared, at least initially, to seriously damage Indo-American relations.

US sanctions on Indian entities involved in the nuclear industry and opposition to international financial institution loans for non-humanitarian assistance projects in India. The United States encouraged India to sign the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]] (CTBT) immediately and without condition. The United States also called for restraint in missile and nuclear testing and deployment by both India and Pakistan.

Tajikistan occupies a strategically important position in Central Asia, bordering Afghanistan, the People's Republic of China and separated by a small strip of Afghan territory from Pakistan. India's role in fighting the Taliban and Al-Qaeda and its strategic rivalry with both China and Pakistan have made its ties with Tajikistan important to its strategic and security policies. Despite their common efforts, bilateral trade has been comparatively low, valued at US$12.09 million in 2005; India's exports to Tajikistan were valued at US$6.2 million and its imports at US$5.89 million. India's military presence and activities have been significant, beginning with India's extensive support of the anti-Taliban [[Northern Alliance|Afghan Northern Alliance]] (ANA). India began renovating the [[Farkhor Air Base]] and stationed aircraft of the Indian Air Force there. The [[Farkhor Air Base]] became fully operational in 2006, and 12 MiG-29 bombers and trainer aircraft are planned to be stationed there.\n;Turkmenistan\n[[File:Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Turkmenistan.jpg|thumb|Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Turkmenistan]]{{Main|India–Turkmenistan relations}}\n;Uzbekistan\n{{main|India–Uzbekistan relations}}\nIndia has an embassy in Tashkent.

Garver,  ''Protracted Contest: Sino-Indian Rivalry in the Twentieth Century'' (2001), post 1950</ref> A series of high-level visits between the two nations have helped improve relations.

While in New Delhi, he signed with the Indian Prime Minister a series of confidence-building measures for the disputed borders. Sino-Indian relations suffered a brief setback in May 1998 when the Indian Defence minister justified the country's nuclear tests by citing potential threats from the PRC. However, in June 1999, during the [[Kargil War|Kargil]] crisis, then-External Affairs Minister [[Jaswant Singh]] visited Beijing and stated that India did not consider China a threat.

Both countries signed a friendship treaty in 1949, where India would assist Bhutan in foreign relations. On 8 February 2007, the Indo-Bhutan Friendship Treaty was substantially revised under the Bhutanese King, [[Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck]]. Whereas in the Treaty of 1949 Article 2 read as \"The Government of India undertakes to exercise no interference in the internal administration of Bhutan. On its part, the Government of Bhutan agrees to be guided by the advice of the Government of India regarding its external relations.\"\n\nIn the revised treaty it now reads as, \"In keeping with the abiding ties of close friendship and cooperation between Bhutan and India, the Government of the Kingdom of Bhutan and the Government of the Republic of India shall cooperate closely with each other on issues relating to their national interests. Neither government shall allow the use of its territory for activities harmful to the national security and interest of the other\". The revised treaty also includes in it the preamble \"Reaffirming their respect for each other's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity\", an element that was absent in the earlier version. The Indo-Bhutan Friendship Treaty of 2007 strengthens Bhutan's status as an independent and sovereign nation.\n[[File:PM Narendra Modi meets Bhutan PM Mr. Tshering Tobgay.jpg|thumb|Indian PM [[Narendra Modi]] meets with Bhutanese PM [[Tshering Tobgay]]]]\nIndia continues to be the largest trade and development partner of Bhutan.

Since then, India has been extending financial assistance to Bhutan's FYPs. The 10th FYP ended in June 2013. India's overall assistance to the 10th FYP was a little over Rs. 5000 crores, excluding grants for hydropower projects.

Three hydroelectric projects (HEPs) totalling 1416 MW, (336 MW [[Chukha District|Chukha]] HEP, the 60 MW Kurichu HEP, and the 1020 MW Tala HEP), are already exporting electricity to India. In 2008 the two governments identified ten more projects for development with a total generation capacity of 10,000 MW. Of these, three projects totalling 2940 MW (1200 MW Punatsangchu-I, 1020 MW Punatsangchu-II and 720 MW Mangdechu HEPs) are under construction and are scheduled to be commissioned in the last quarter of 2017–2018. Out of the remaining 7 HEPs, 4 projects totalling 2120 MW (600 MW Kholongchhu, 180 MW Bunakha, 570 MW Wangchu and 770 MW Chamkarchu) will be constructed under a Joint Venture model, for which a Framework Inter-Governmental Agreement was signed between both governments in 2014.

The principal source of contention between India and its western neighbour has been the [[Kashmir conflict]]. After an invasion by [[Pashtuns|Pashtun tribesmen]] and Pakistani paramilitary forces, the Hindu Maharaja of the [[Dogras|Dogra]] Kingdom of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Hari Singh]], and its Muslim Prime Minister, [[Sheikh Abdullah]], signed an [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|Instrument of Accession]] with New Delhi. The [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|First Kashmir War]] started after the [[Indian Army]] entered [[Srinagar]], the capital of the state, to secure the area from the invading forces. The war ended in December 1948 with the [[Line of Control]] dividing the erstwhile princely state into territories administered by Pakistan (northern and western areas) and India (southern, central and northeastern areas). Pakistan contested the legality of the Instrument of Accession since the Dogra Kingdom has signed a [[standstill agreement]] with it. The [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] started following the failure of Pakistan's [[Operation Gibraltar]], which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against rule by India. The five-week war caused thousands of casualties on both sides. It ended in a United Nations (UN) mandated ceasefire and the subsequent issuance of the [[Tashkent Declaration]]. India and Pakistan [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|went to war]] again in 1971, this time the conflict being over [[East Pakistan]]. The [[1971 Bangladesh genocide|large-scale atrocities]] committed there by the Pakistan army led to millions of Bengali refugees pouring over into India. India, along with the [[Mukti Bahini]], defeated Pakistan and the Pakistani forces surrendered on the eastern front. The war resulted in the creation of Bangladesh. In 1998, India carried out the [[Pokhran-II]] nuclear tests which was followed by Pakistan's [[Chagai-I]] tests. Following the [[Lahore Declaration]] in February 1999, relations briefly improved. A few months later, however, Pakistani paramilitary forces and [[Pakistan Army]], infiltrated in large numbers into the [[Kargil district]] of Indian Kashmir. This initiated the [[Kargil War]] after India moved in thousands of troops to successfully flush out the infiltrators. Although the conflict did not result in a full-scale war between India and Pakistan, relations between the two reached an all-time low which worsened even further following the involvement of Pakistan-based terrorists in the hijacking of the [[Indian Airlines Flight 814]] in December 1999. Attempts to normalise relations, such as the [[Agra summit]] held in July 2001, failed. An [[2001 Indian Parliament attack|attack on the Indian Parliament]] in December 2001, which was blamed on Pakistan, which had condemned the attack<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1707865.stm |title=SOUTH ASIA {{pipe}} Indian parliament attack kills 12 |publisher=BBC News |date=13 December 2001 |access-date=21 November 2009}}</ref> caused a [[2001–02 India–Pakistan standoff|military standoff between the two countries]] which lasted for nearly a year raising fears of [[nuclear warfare]]. However, a peace process, initiated in 2003, led to improved relations in the following years.[[File:The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi meeting the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Nawaz Sharif, at Raiwind, in Pakistan on December 25, 2015 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Prime Minister of India|PM]] [[Narendra Modi]] meeting Former [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], [[Nawaz Sharif]], at [[Raiwind]], [[Pakistan]] <br />{{small|(2015, last formal dialogue)}}]]\n\nSince the initiation of the peace process, several confidence-building measures (CBMs) between India and Pakistan have taken shape.

Political relations are close, trade and investments have increased dramatically, infrastructural linkages are constantly being augmented, defence collaboration has increased and there is a general, broad-based improvement across all sectors of bilateral cooperation. India was the first country to respond to Sri Lanka's request for assistance after the tsunami in December 2004. In July 2006, India evacuated 430 Sri Lankan nationals from Lebanon, first to Cyprus by Indian Navy ships and then to Delhi and Colombo by special Air India flights.\n\nThere exists a broad consensus within the Sri Lankan polity on the primacy of India in Sri Lanka's external relations matrix. Both the major political parties in Sri Lanka, the [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] and the [[United Nationalist Party]] have contributed to the rapid development of bilateral relations in the last ten years. Sri Lanka has supported India's candidature to the permanent membership of the UN Security Council.<ref>[http://mea.gov.in/foreignrelation/srilanka.htm Brief on India-Sri Lanka Relations], Ministry of External Affairs (BSM Division: Sri Lanka)</ref>\n\n[[File:Map of India WV.svg|thumb|India and its neighbour countries.|left]]\n\n;SAARC\nCertain aspects of India's relations within the subcontinent are conducted through the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC). Its members other than India are [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[Maldives]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. Established in 1985, SAARC encourages cooperation in agriculture, rural development, science and technology, culture, health, population control, narcotics control and anti-terrorism.\n\nSAARC has intentionally stressed these \"core issues\" and avoided more divisive political issues, although the political dialogue is often conducted on the margins of SAARC meetings. In 1993, India and its SAARC partners signed an agreement to gradually lower tariffs within the region. Forward movement in SAARC has come to a standstill because of the tension between India and Pakistan, and the SAARC Summit originally scheduled for, but not held in, November 1999 has not been rescheduled. The Fourteenth SAARC Summit was held during 3–4 April 2007 in New Delhi.

The first Philippine envoy to India was the late Foreign Secretary Narciso Ramos. Seven years after India's independence in 1947, the Philippines and India signed a Treaty of Friendship on 11 July 1952 in Manila to strengthen the friendly relations existing between the two countries. Soon after, the Philippine Legation in New Delhi was established and then elevated to an embassy. However, due to foreign policy differences as a result of the bipolar alliance structure of the Cold War, the development of bilateral relations was stunted. It was only in 1976 that relations started to normalise when [[Aditya Vikram Birla|Aditya Birla]], one of India's successful industrialists, met with then-President Ferdinand E. Marcos to explore possibilities of setting up joint ventures in the Philippines.\n\nToday, like India, the Philippines is the leading voice-operated business process outsourcing (BPO) source in terms of revenue (US$5.7) and number of people (500,000) employed in the sector. In partnership with the Philippines, India has 20 IT/BPO companies in the Philippines. Philippines-India bilateral trade stood at US$986.60 million in 2009. In 2004 it was US$600 million. Both countries aim to reach US$1 billion by 2010. 60,000 Indians are living in the Philippines. The Philippines and India signed in October 2007 the Framework for Bilateral Cooperation which created the PH-India JCBC.

[[Syriac Christianity]], originating in ancient Syria, spread further to the East and created the first [[Christianity in India|Christian]] communities in ancient India. The ancient Syriac language among the Syrian Christians of Kerala was also brought to Kerala by St Thomas in the 1st century CE. Even today the language continues to be taught in colleges and universities in Kerala.\n\nA common nationalism and secular orientation, membership of NAM and similar perceptions on many issues further strengthened the bond between the two states.

India and Turkey's relationship alters from unsureness to collaboration when the two nations work together to combat terrorism in Central and South Asia, and the Middle East. India and Turkey are also connected by history, seeing as they have known each other since the days of the [[Ottoman Empire]], and seeing as India was one of the countries to send aid to Turkey following its [[Turkish War of Independence|war of independence]]. The Indian real estate firm GMR has invested in and is working towards the modernisation of [[Istanbul]]'s [[Sabiha Gökçen International Airport]].\n\nThe relations took a nose-dive after [[President of Turkey|Turkish President]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] spoke against India on the [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir issue]] and supported Pakistan, during his address at [[United Nations General Assembly]] after Pakistan PM [[Imran Khan]], in September 2019. In February 2020, he visited Islamabad and held talks with Imran Khan, on \"improving and bolding the relations with Islamabad\". At the end of the month, during the [[2020 Delhi riots|riots in Delhi]] and [[Citizenship Amendment Act protests|CAA-NRC protests]] in India, he criticised the government for its policies.

There is a record of an Indian bishop visiting [[Rome]] in the early part of the 12th century.\n\nThe [[diplomatic mission]] was established as the [[Apostolic Delegation]] to the East Indies in 1881, and included [[Ceylon]], and was extended to [[Malacca|Malaca]] in 1889, then to Burma in 1920, and eventually included [[Goa]] in 1923. It was raised to an Internunciature by Pope [[Pius XII]] on 12 June 1948 and to a full Apostolic Nunciature by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 22 August 1967.\n\nThere have been three Papal visits to India. The first Pope to visit India was [[Pope Paul VI]], who visited [[Mumbai]] in 1964 to attend the [[Eucharistic Congress]]. Pope [[John Paul II]] visited India in February 1986 and November 1999.

[[Non-Aligned Movement|Nonalignment]] had its origins in India's [[colonial India|colonial]] experience and the nonviolent [[Indian independence movement]] led by the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], which left India determined to be the master of its fate in an international system dominated politically by [[Cold War]] alliances and economically by Western [[capitalism]] and Soviet [[communism]]. The principles of nonalignment, as articulated by Nehru and his successors, were the preservation of India's freedom of action internationally through refusal to align India with any bloc or alliance, particularly those led by the United States or the [[Soviet Union]]; nonviolence and international cooperation as a means of settling international disputes. Nonalignment was a consistent feature of Indian foreign policy by the late 1940s and enjoyed strong, almost unquestioning support among the Indian elite.\n\nThe term \"Non-Alignment\" was coined by [[V. K. Krishna Menon|V K Menon]] in his speech at the UN in 1953 which was later used by Indian Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] during his speech in 1954 in [[Colombo]], Sri Lanka. In this speech, Nehru described the five pillars to be used as a guide for [[China–India relations]], which were first put forth by [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|PRC Premier]] [[Zhou Enlai]]. Called [[Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence|Panchsheel]] (five restraints), these principles would later serve as the basis of the Non-Aligned Movement. The five principles were:\n# ''Mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty''\n# ''Mutual non-aggression''\n# ''Mutual non-interference in domestic affairs''\n# ''Equality and mutual benefit''\n# ''Peaceful co-existence''\n[[File:P20210924AS-1147-2 (51707173079).jpg|thumb|From left to right: Prime Minister of Japan [[Yoshihide Suga]], Prime Minister of India [[Narendra Modi]], President of United States [[Joe Biden]] and Prime Minister of Australia [[Scott Morrison]] in [[White House]], USA.]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]'s concept of nonalignment brought India considerable international prestige among newly independent states that shared India's concerns about the military confrontation between the [[superpower]]s and the influence of the former colonial powers. [[New Delhi]] used nonalignment to establish a significant role for itself as a leader of the newly independent world in such multilateral organisations as the [[United Nations]] (UN) and the Nonaligned Movement. The signing of the Treaty of Peace, Friendship, and Cooperation between India and the Soviet Union in 1971 and India's involvement in the internal affairs of its smaller neighbours in the 1970s and 1980s tarnished New Delhi's image as a nonaligned nation and led some observers to note that in practice, nonalignment applied only to India's relations with countries outside South Asia.\n\n;Quad Alliance\n{{Main|Quadrilateral Security Dialogue}}\nThe '''Quadrilateral Security Dialogue''' ('''QSD''', also known as the '''Quad''') is an informal strategic dialogue between the [[United States]], [[India]], [[Japan]] and [[Australia]] that is maintained by talks between member countries. The dialogue was initiated in 2007 by [[Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Shinzo Abe]], with the support of [[Vice President of the United States|American Vice-President]] [[Dick Cheney]], [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] and Former [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Manmohan Singh]]. The dialogue was paralleled by joint military exercises of an unprecedented scale, titled [[Malabar (naval exercise)|Exercise Malabar]]. The diplomatic and military arrangement was widely viewed as a response to increased Chinese economic and military power. On 12 March 2021, '''the first summit meeting''' was held virtually between [[President of the United States|U.S President]] [[Joe Biden]], Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]], Japanese Prime Minister [[Yoshihide Suga]] and Australian Prime Minister [[Scott Morrison]].\n\n;United Nations\n\n{{Main|India and the United Nations}}[[File:Modi at the 69th UN general assembly.jpg|thumb|[[Narendra Modi]], The current [[Prime Minister of India]], addressing the 69th [[United Nations General Assembly|UNGA]], in 2014]]India was among the original members of the [[United Nations]] that signed the [[Declaration by United Nations]] at Washington on 1 January 1942 and also participated in the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]] in [[San Francisco]] from 25 April to 26 June 1945.

Substantial trade with the former Soviet Union plummeted after the Soviet collapse and has yet to recover. Longstanding military supply relationships were similarly disrupted due to questions over financing, although Russia continues to be India's largest supplier of military systems and spare parts.\n\nThe relationship with USSR was tested (and proven) during the 1971 war with Pakistan, which led to the subsequent liberation of Bangladesh. Soon after the victory of the Indian Armed Forces, one of the foreign delegates to visit India was [[Sergey Gorshkov|Admiral S.G. Gorshkov]], Chief of the Soviet Navy. During his visit to Mumbai (Bombay), he came on board INS ''Vikrant''. During a conversation with Vice Admiral Swaraj Prakash, Gorshkov asked the Vice Admiral, \"Were you worried about a battle against the American carrier?\" He answered himself: \"Well, you had no reason to be worried, as I had a Soviet nuclear submarine trailing the American task force all the way into the Indian Ocean.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/history/1971war/9-cold-war.html |title=Cold War Games\n |website=bharat-rakshak.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702234406/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/history/1971war/9-cold-war.html |archive-date=2 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n;Yugoslavia\n{{main|India–Yugoslavia relations}}\n\n[[India]] had formal relations with the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] until 1992 with the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia]].\n\n==Border disputes==\n{{Main|List of disputed territories of India}}\nIndia's territorial disputes with neighbouring Pakistan and the People's Republic of China have played a crucial role in its foreign policy.

Indian forces occupied the area in 1962 after China and India fought their border war. Three villages are located in the disputed zone: Kuti [Kuthi, 30°19'N, 80°46'E], Gunji, and Knabe. India and Nepal disagree about how to interpret the 1816 Sugauli treaty between the British East India Company and Nepal, which delimited the boundary along the Maha Kali River (Sarda River in India). The dispute intensified in 1997 as the Nepali parliament considered a treaty on the hydroelectric development of the river. India and Nepal differ as to which stream constitutes the source of the river. Nepal regards the Limpiyadhura as the source; India claims the Lipu Lekh. Nepal has reportedly tabled an 1856 map from the British India Office to support its position. The countries have held several meetings about the dispute and discussed jointly surveying to resolve the issue.<ref>''The Kathmandu Post'', 16 July 1997, 2 July 1997, 31 May 1996;''The Hindustan Times'' (Delhi), 9 June 1997, p. 13; Xinhua 11 April 1997</ref> Although the Indo-Nepali dispute appears to be minor, it was aggravated in 1962 by tensions between China and India.
