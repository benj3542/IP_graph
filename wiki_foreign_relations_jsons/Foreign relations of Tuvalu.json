"{{short description|none}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2020}}\n{{Use British English|date=July 2015}}\n{{Politics of Tuvalu}}\nFrom 1916 to 1975, [[Tuvalu]] was part of the [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]] colony of the United Kingdom. A [[1974 Ellice Islands self-determination referendum|referendum was held in 1974]] to determine whether the Gilbert Islands and Ellice Islands should each have their own administration. As a consequence of the referendum, the separate British colonies of [[Kiribati]] and Tuvalu were formed. Tuvalu became fully independent as a [[sovereign state]] within the [[Commonwealth realm|Commonwealth]] on 1 October 1978. On 5 September 2000, Tuvalu became the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1290|189th member of the United Nations]].\n\nTuvalu is a very small [[island country]] of {{convert|26|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. In terms of physical land size, Tuvalu is the fourth smallest country in the world, larger only than the [[Vatican City]]—0.44&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>; [[Monaco]]—1.95&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and [[Nauru]]—21&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. it is the second-least populated independent country in the world, with a population of 10,507 (2017 Census).<ref name=\"C2012\">{{cite web|title= Population of communities in Tuvalu| publisher=Thomas Brinkhoff|date =2017|url= http://www.citypopulation.de/Tuvalu.html | access-date=27 September 2020}}</ref>  Because of the small size of the [[economy of Tuvalu]], its foreign relations are limited to its most important partners. Tuvalu maintains close relations with Fiji, New Zealand, Australia (which has maintained a [[High Commission]] in Tuvalu since 2018), Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the [[European Union]].\n\nAs a small Pacific Island nation, a major concern is the effect of [[climate change]] on the [[atolls]]. Tuvalu is a [[developing country]] and works with other island states, which tend to share similar [[sustainable development]] challenges, such as the [[Small Island Developing States|Pacific Small Island Developing States]] (PSIDS).\n\nTuvalu participates in the work of [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community|the Pacific Community (SPC)]] and is a member of the [[Pacific Islands Forum]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]]. It has maintained a mission at the United Nations in New York City since 2000. \n\n==International organisational participation==\n\n===Tuvalu and the Commonwealth of Nations===\n\nOn 1 September 2000, [[Tuvalu]] became a full member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].
