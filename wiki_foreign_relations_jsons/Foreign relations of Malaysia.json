It has also in recent times been an active proponent of regional co-operation.\n\n==Foreign Policy 1957–1969==\n\n[[Malaysia]] has been a member of the Commonwealth since independence in 1957, when it entered into the [[Anglo-Malayan Defence Agreement]] (AMDA) with the United Kingdom whereby Britain guaranteed the defence of [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] (and later Malaysia). The presence of British and other Commonwealth troops were crucial to Malaysia's security during the [[Malayan Emergency]] (1948–1960) and the [[Indonesian Confrontation]] (1962–1966), which was sparked by Malaya's merger with the British colonies of Singapore, [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]] and [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]] to form Malaysia in 1963.\n\nThe British defence guarantee ended following Britain's decision in 1967 to withdraw its forces east of [[Suez]], and was replaced in 1971 with the [[Five Power Defence Arrangements]] (FPDA) by which Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore agreed to co-operate in the area of defence, and to \"consult\" in the event of external aggression or the threat of attack on Malaysia or Singapore. The FPDA continues to operate, and the Five Powers have a permanent Integrated Area Defence System based at [[Royal Malaysian Air Force|RMAF]] [[Butterworth, Malaysia|Butterworth]], and organise annual naval and air exercises.\n\nUnder the leadership of Prime Minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] (up to 1970), Malaysia pursued a strongly pro-Commonwealth anti-communist foreign policy. Nonetheless, Malaysia was active in the opposition to [[apartheid]] that saw South Africa quit the Commonwealth in 1961, and was a founding member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) in 1967 and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC) in 1969, with the Tunku as its first Secretary-General in 1971.\n\n==Foreign policy since 1969==\n\nUnder Prime Minister [[Abdul Razak Hussein]], Malaysia shifted its policy towards non-alignment and neutrality. Malaysia's foreign policy is officially based on the principle of neutrality and maintaining peaceful relations with all countries, regardless of their ideology or political system, and to further develop relations with other countries in the region.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kln.gov.my/web/guest/foreign_policy | title = Malaysia's Foreign Policy | access-date = 21 September 2010 | work = [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Malaysia)]] | archive-date = 4 July 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180704114645/http://www.kln.gov.my/web/guest/foreign_policy | url-status = live }}</ref> In 1971, ASEAN issued its neutralist and anti-nuclear ''Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality'' (ZOPFAN) Declaration. In the same year, Malaysia joined the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Consistent with this policy Malaysia established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1974.\n\nThis policy shift was continued and strengthened by Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]], who pursued a regionalist and pro-South policy with at times strident [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] rhetoric. He long sought to establish an East Asian Economic Group as an alternative to [[APEC]], excluding Australia, New Zealand and the Americas, and during his premiership Malaysia signed up to an ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and ASEAN+3, a regional forum with China, Japan and South Korea.\n\nA strong tenet of Malaysia's policy is national sovereignty and the right of a country to control its domestic affairs.<ref name=\"dfat\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/malaysia/malaysia_brief.html |title=Malaysia country brief |publisher=dfat.gov.au |date=October 2010 |access-date=19 February 2011 |archive-date=27 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027035312/http://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/malaysia/malaysia_brief.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\nMalaysia views regional co-operation as the cornerstone of its foreign policy.
