Assad had denied any involvement, however President Obama claims to have intelligence proving otherwise.

US Navy warships USS Porter and USS Ross in the Mediterranean Sea launched dozens of Tomahawk missiles at Syria's Shayrat air base.  The strikes were in reaction to what Washington says was a sarin poison gas attack by the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that killed at least 70 people in the Idlib region of Syria.  U.S. officials informed Russian forces ahead of the missile strikes, which Russian military were in Syria actively supporting and assisting al-Assad during Syria's civil war, and US air strikes avoided hitting Russian personnel. Trump, who authorized the launch of 59 Tomahawk missiles from Navy warships in the Mediterranean Sea on an air base near Homs were in direct response to Bashar al-Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons in the town of [[Khan Shaykhun chemical attack|Khan Shaykhun]] on 4 April 2017. Following airstrikes were conducted on 8 April 2017, on the Syrian city that was the site of chemical weapons attack earlier.\n*On 7 October 2019, the President of the United States ordered the withdrawal of US military troops stationed on the Syrian-Turkey border. This withdrawal of military support was ordered by the President with disapproval of the Pentagon and the US Intelligence community. The US president ordered the withdrawal of military troops under the premise that Turkey would not invade the region being held by Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF); however Turkey attacked the SDF within 24 hours of US military withdrawal from the region.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/10/syrian-civil-war-guide-isis/410746/ | title=The Confused Person's Guide to the Syrian Civil War | website=[[The Atlantic]] | date=29 October 2015 }}</ref>\n|-\n|{{Flag|Uruguay}}\n|11 October 1946\n|\n* Both countries established diplomatic relations on 11 October 1946.<ref name=\"auto11\"/>\n* Syria is accredited to Uruguay from its embassy in [[Buenos Aires]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=24 June 2022 |title=El Embajador de Siria presentó cartas credenciales en Uruguay – Diario Sirio Libanés |language=spanish |publisher=Diarios Sirio Libane |url=http://www.diariosiriolibanes.com.ar/Actualidad/Am%C3%A9rica-Latina/El-Embajador-de-Siria-present%C3%B3-cartas-credenciales-en-Uruguay |access-date=10 May 2023}}</ref>\n*In 2019, Dr. Faisal Mekdad received a senior military delegation headed by [[Armed Forces of Uruguay]] [[Defence Staff (Uruguay)|Army Chief of Staff]], Major General Marcelo Montaner.

With the end of the war in August 1988, Syria began a slow process of reintegration with the other Arab states. In 1989, it joined with the rest of the Arab world in readmitting [[Egypt]] to the 19th [[Arab League]] Summit at [[Casablanca]].\n\nThis decision, prompted in part by Syria's need for Arab League support of its own position in [[Lebanon]], marked the end of the Syrian-led opposition to Egypt and the 1977–79 [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]] initiatives toward [[Israel]], as well as the [[Camp David Accords]]. It coincided with the end of the 10-year Arab subsidy to Syria and other front-line Arab countries pledged at [[Baghdad]] in 1978. Syria re-established full diplomatic relations with Egypt in 1989. In the 1990–1991 [[Gulf War]], Syria joined other Arab states in the US-led multinational coalition against Iraq. In 1998, Syria began a slow rapprochement with Iraq, driven primarily by economic needs. In this period, Syria continued to play an active [[pan-Arab]] role, which intensified as the Israel-Palestine peace process collapsed in September 2000 with the start of the second Palestinian uprising ([[Second Intifada|Intifada]]) against Israel. Though it voted in favor of [[UN Security Council Resolution 1441|UNSCR 1441]] in 2002, Syria was against coalition military action in Iraq in 2003. However, the Syrian government accepted [[UN Security Council Resolution 1483|UNSCR 1483]] (after being absent for the actual vote), which lifted sanctions on Iraq and established a framework to assist the Iraqi people in determining their political future and rebuilding their economy.\n\nAfter start of the war in 2011, much of the Middle East condemned Syria's handling of the civil uprising, with only a few countries in the Middle East supporting Syria, most notably Iran, Iraq and Lebanon.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Abkhazia}}||4 September 2018||{{small|See [[Abkhazia–Syria relations]]}}\n*Syria has an embassy in [[Sukhumi]]. \n*Abkhazia had an embassy in Damascus.

Lebanon was part of [[Ottoman Syria]] until 1926. The presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon dates to 1976, when President [[Hafez al-Assad]] intervened in the [[Lebanese civil war]] on behalf of [[Maronite]] Christians. Following the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Syrian and Israeli forces clashed in eastern Lebanon. The late U.S. Ambassador [[Philip Habib]] negotiated a cease-fire in Lebanon and the subsequent evacuation of [[PLO]] fighters from West [[Beirut]]. However, Syrian opposition blocked implementation of the [[May 17 Agreement|17 May 1983 Lebanese-Israeli accord]] on the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon. Following the February 1984 withdrawal of the UN Multinational Force from Beirut and the departure of most of Israel's forces from southern Lebanon a year later, Syria launched an unsuccessful initiative to reconcile warring Lebanese factions and establish a permanent cease-fire. Syria actively participated in the March–September 1989 fighting between the Christian Lebanese Forces and Muslim forces allied with Syria. In 1989, Syria endorsed the Charter of National Reconciliation, or \"[[Taif Accord]]\", a comprehensive plan for ending the Lebanese conflict negotiated under the auspices of [[Saudi Arabia]], Algeria, and [[Morocco]].\n\nAt the request of Lebanese President [[Elias Hrawi|Hrawi]], the Syrian military took joint action with the Lebanese Armed Forces on 13 October 1990, to oust rebel Gen. [[Michel Aoun]] who had defied efforts at reconciliation with the legitimate Government of Lebanon. The process of disarming and disbanding the many Lebanese militias began in earnest in early 1991. In May 1991, Lebanon and Syria signed the treaty of brotherhood, cooperation, and coordination called for in the Taif Accord, which is intended to provide the basis for many aspects of Syrian-Lebanese relations. The treaty provides the most explicit recognition to date by the Syrian Government of Lebanon's independence and sovereignty.\n\nAccording to the U.S. interpretation of the [[Taif Accord]], Syria and Lebanon were to have decided on the redeployment of Syrian forces from Beirut and other coastal areas of Lebanon by September 1992. Israeli occupation of Lebanon until May 2000, the breakdown of peace negotiations between Syria and Israel that same year, and intensifying Arab/Israeli tensions since the start of the second Palestinian uprising in September 2000 have helped delay full implementation of the Taif Accords. The UN declared that Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon fulfilled the requirements of [[UN Security Council Resolution 425]]. However, Syria and Lebanon claimed that UNSCR 425 had not been fully implemented because Israel did not withdraw from an area of the Golan Heights called [[Shebaa Farms]], which had been occupied by [[Israel]] in 1967, and which Syria now claimed was part of Lebanon. The United Nations does not recognize this claim. However, Lebanese resistance groups such as [[Hezbollah]] use it to justify attacks against Israeli forces in that region, creating a potentially dangerous flashpoint along the Lebanon-Israeli border.\n\nIn 2005, Syrian troops withdrew from Lebanon after the assassination of Lebanese Sunni Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on 14 February 2005. In December 2008, The Syrian Embassy was opened in Beirut for the first time in history since both countries gained their Independence during the 1940s. In March 2009, Lebanon followed and opened its embassy in Damascus. On 19 December 2009, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Al-Hariri visited Syria, and stayed in Damascus for three days meeting with President Bashar Al-Assad & breaking the ice between the two

Relations have further been degraded due to a serious incident that occurred with the Syrian downing of a Turkish military training flight in June 2012. Relations worsened further in May 2013 following a border incident involving two car bombs exploding in the town of Reyhanlı, Hatay Province, Turkey. At least 43 people were killed and 140 more were injured in the attack. The car bombs were left outside Reyhanlı's town hall and post office. The first exploded at around 13:45 local time (10:45 GMT)[40] and the second exploded about 15 minutes later.\n\nThe issue that cemented the crack in the relations was Turkey's reported dealings with the [[Islamic State]] (an enemy of the Syrian government) in oil and weapons by various sources.
