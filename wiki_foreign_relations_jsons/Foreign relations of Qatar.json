By December 2023, an additional six Ukrainian children were scheduled to be repatriated from Russia to Ukraine under a Qatar-brokered agreement. In February 2024, a third group of 11 children was successfully returned to their Ukrainian families with the assistance of Qatar's mediation. On 21 March 2024, a new batch of children exchange between Moscow and Kyiv took place at Qatar's Embassy in Moscow, facilitated by Qatar and attended by Ambassador ''Sheikh Ahmed bin Nasser bin Jassim Al Thani'', as confirmed by Russian Children's Ombudswoman ''Maria Lvova-Belova''. Furthermore, the ambassador ''Sheikh Ahmed'' expressed gratitude to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani for their support throughout this process.\n\nQatar has actively extended its role as a global mediator under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani]]. In May 2025 interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Sheikh Mohammed emphasized Qatar’s “technocratic” approach to negotiations, citing successful mediation in high‑profile conflicts such as the release of over 130 hostages from Gaza, talks involving Hamas and Israel, negotiations in Afghanistan and the war in Ukraine, and reunification of Ukrainian children taken to Russia.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sheikh Mohammed al Thani Interview |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/12/mohammed-al-thani-diplomacy-interview-qatar/}}</ref>\n\n=== Cultural and religious activities ===\n[[Qatar]] is an Islamic state with multi-religious minorities like most of the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf countries]] with waves of migration over the last 30 years. The official state religion is Wahhabi Sunni Islam. The community is made up of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] [[Muslims]], [[Christians]], [[Hindus]], and small groups of [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and [[Baháʼí Faith|Baha'is]]. [[Muslims]] form 65.5% of the Qatari population, followed by [[Hindus]] at 15.4%, [[Christians]] at 14.2%, [[Buddhists]] at 3.3% and the rest 1.9% of the population follow other religions or are unaffiliated. Qatar is also home to numerous other religions mostly from the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Qatar |url=https://rpl.hds.harvard.edu/religion-context/country-profiles/qatar |access-date=12 June 2023 |website=rpl.hds.harvard.edu |language=en |archive-date=30 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230530081000/https://rpl.hds.harvard.edu/religion-context/country-profiles/qatar |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe country has also hosted numerous interfaith dialogue conferences.\n\nThe culture of Qatar is strongly influenced by traditional [[Arab culture|Bedouin culture]], with less acute influence deriving from [[India]], [[East Africa]] and elsewhere in the [[Persian Gulf]]. The peninsula's harsh climatic conditions compelled its inhabitants to turn to the sea for sustenance. Thus, there is a distinct emphasis placed on the sea in local culture. Literature and folklore themes are often related to sea-based activities. Oral arts such as poetry and singing were historically more prevalent than [[figurative art]] because of the restrictions placed by [[Aniconism in Islam|Islam on depictions of sentient beings]]; however, certain visual art disciplines such as calligraphy, architecture and textile arts were widely practiced. Figurative arts were gradually assimilated into the country's culture during the [[History of Qatar#Oil drilling|oil era]].\n\n===Foreign aid===\n{{Main|Qatari foreign aid}}\n[[Qatar]]'s [[international aid]] program has expanded dramatically since the beginning of 2010, and focuses heavily on the [[Arab world]], most notably in the humanitarian crises in [[Syria]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Papers/2015/06/trends-issues-qatari-foreign-aid-kharas/Kharas-Trends-and-Issues-in-Qatar-Aid-v2.pdf?la=en,|title=Trends and Issues in Qatari Foreign Aid|website=The Brookings Institution|access-date=5 June 2017|archive-date=26 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626142741/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Papers/2015/06/trends-issues-qatari-foreign-aid-kharas/Kharas-Trends-and-Issues-in-Qatar-Aid-v2.pdf?la=en,|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[UN]] [[OCHA]]'s Financial Tracking Service, Qatar's international aid increased from less than $10 million annually in the pre-[[Arab Spring]] period to the hundreds of millions following the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fts.unocha.org/pageloader.aspx?page=Profile-donorCountrylist,|title=Qatar Country Profile: 2015, Financial Tracking Service, 2015|access-date=5 June 2017|archive-date=26 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626142046/https://fts.unocha.org/pageloader.aspx?page=Profile-donorCountrylist,|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFor example, in 2012, according to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Qatar)|Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], the country donated more than QAR3 billion (or c. £524 million) through governmental and non-governmental aid to nearly 100 countries across the globe.<ref name=MOFA>{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.gov.qa/en/SiteServices/MediaCenter/News/Pages/News20131111082549.aspx,|title=News20131111082549|website=www.mofa.gov.qa|access-date=9 June 2017|archive-date=5 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905230822/http://www.mofa.gov.qa/en/SiteServices/MediaCenter/News/Pages/News20131111082549.aspx,|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nQatari leadership has since pledged publicly to reduce suffering of victims and to achieve and support global partnerships for the achievement of foreign countries' [[Millennium Development Goals]].

Aid typically encompasses a range of essential provisions, including but not limited to shelter essentials, electricity generators, food, and medical commodities.\n\nRecently, [[Qatar Charity]] (QC) launched the 'Libya Appeal' campaign, aimed at providing aid to the Libyan population grappling with the consequences of severe floods. These floods have resulted in the loss of numerous lives and the displacement of a significant number of individuals.\n\nSheikh [[Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani|Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani]] also conveyed his heartfelt condolences to the victims affected by the catastrophic floods in [[Libya]] through a message posted on the social media platform Twitter.  \"I extend to our brothers in Libya my sincere condolences and sympathy for the victims of the catastrophic floods, and we in Qatar declare our complete solidarity with the Libyan people to overcome this painful ordeal, and we ask God to have mercy on the dead, bring back the missing, and heal the wounded,\".
