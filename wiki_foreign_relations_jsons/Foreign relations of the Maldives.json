"{{Short description|none}}\n{{update|date=August 2024}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2020}}\n\n{{Politics of the Maldives}}\n\nThe [[Maldives]] has remained an independent nation throughout its [[recorded history]], save for a brief spell of Portuguese occupation in the mid-16th century.  From 1900 to 1965, the country was a British [[protectorate]] while retaining full internal sovereignty. At its independence in 1965, the Maldives joined the [[United Nations]] on 20 September.\n\nSince 1978, the Maldives has followed a policy of international engagement, intensifying links with strategic partners and the international system. It joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in 1982. A founder member of [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC), the Maldives is also a member of the [[Bretton Woods system]]. It is also party to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) as well as numerous conventions on the protection of the environment, the suppression of terrorism, disarmament and on the promotion and protection of human rights.\n\nIn its transition towards a [[liberal democracy]], the Maldives has established dialogue and collaboration with international human rights organizations, such as [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], and acceded to numerous human rights instruments such as the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR). During the same period, the country has also intensified links with the [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Association]] (CPA) and joined the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] (IPU).\n\nThe Maldives retains diplomatic relations with 172 countries, with resident [[Diplomatic mission|diplomatic missions]] in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Ankara]], [[Beijing]], [[Berlin]], [[Brussels]], [[Colombo]], [[D.C.]], [[Dhaka]], [[Geneva]], [[Islamabad]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[London]], [[New Delhi]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Riyadh]], [[Singapore]] and [[Tokyo]] and non-resident accreditation in numerous other countries, including [[Bhutan]] and [[Nepal]].\n\nThe country’s  issues of interest include advancing national development, supporting international peace and security, including the protection of the environment and the promotion of human rights, and upholding the purposes and principles enshrined in the [[Charter of the United Nations]].\n\n[[File:Secretary Clinton Speaks With Maldivian Foreign Minister Naseem (5934554131).jpg|thumb|Former US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] receives Former Foreign Minister [[Ahmed Naseem]], July 2011]]\n\n==Human rights==\n\nThe Maldives has become a very strong advocate for the promotion and protection of human rights following the democratic transition in 2008. At the United Nations, the Maldives has since then called for all countries to adhere to their obligations under international law, and to respect fundamental freedoms and rights. In 2005, the Maldives became one of the promoters of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention Against Torture after having earlier acceded to the convention. The Maldives is party to the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC), the [[Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD), [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (CRPD) the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) and its optional protocol. In April 2006, the Maldives issued a standing invitation to all special procedures mandates of the UN human rights machinery to visit to the Maldives.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}\n\nThe Maldives was elected to the [[Human Rights Council]] in 2010 for the term 2010–2013, in which it has actively supported and contributed to the promotion and protection of human rights for all. It has co-sponsored a number of resolution establishing United Nations Special Mandates, and supported resolutions on improving human rights situation in the Middle East during the [[Arab Spring]], namely on investigating [[human rights in Libya|human rights violations in Libya]] and [[Human rights in Syria|Syria]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}\n\nMaldives has especially close relations with Sri Lanka and India, countries with which it shares much culture.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}\n\n==International organizations==\n\n===United Nations===\n\nMaldives became a [[Member states of the United Nations|member state of the United Nations]] on 21 September 1965. The nation became a member of [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) on the same date.\n\nThe Maldives became a member of the following UN agencies and conferences on the following dates:\n* [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) and [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) - 21 September 1965.\n* [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO) -  5 May 1988\n* [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) - 18 July 1980\n* [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) - on 15 December 1972\n* [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF) - 6 April 1971\n\nThe United Nations Development Programme has a representative resident in Malé, as do UNICEF and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).\n\nAt the UN, the Maldives has highlighted the vulnerability of small states to various threats including terrorism, activities of mercenaries and [[transnational organized crime]]. It is also a strong advocate of counter-terrorism and is party to all the main UN conventions against terrorism. Development co-operation is a major priority of the Maldives and it has been campaigning at the UN for a more structured means of graduation from the list of [[least developed countries]] targeted for preferential assistance. The main donors to the Maldives are [[Japan]], [[India]], and [[Australia]].\n\n===Other intergovernmental organizations===\n\nThe Maldives became a member of [[Non-Aligned Movement]] on 15 August 1976.\n\nThe Maldives were a founder member in 1985 of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) and the nation plays a very active role in the association. It has taken the lead in calling for a South Asian Free Trade Agreement, the formulation of a Social Charter, the initiation of informal political consultations in SAARC forums, the lobbying for greater action on environmental issues, the proposal of numerous human rights measures such as the regional convention on child rights and for setting up a SAARC Human Rights Resource Centre. The Maldives is also an advocate of greater international profile for SAARC such as through formulating common positions at the UN.

However, the Maldives has often distanced itself from positions taken by the OIC on matters such as the [[Kashmir dispute]], which it regards as a bilateral issue to be settled peacefully between India and Pakistan. It has also not supported the OIC position on issues such as that of Cyprus, subscribing instead to the international stance taken by the United Nations. The Maldives became a member of OIC in August 1974.
