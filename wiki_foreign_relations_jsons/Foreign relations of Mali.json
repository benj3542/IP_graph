Mali's foreign policy orientation became increasingly pragmatic and pro-Western over time. Since the institution of a democratic form of government in 1992, Mali's relations with the West in general and the United States in particular have improved significantly. U.S.-Malian relations are described by the U.S. Department of State as \"excellent and expanding,\" especially given Mali's recent record of democratic stability in the volatile area of West Africa and its avowed support of the war on terrorism. Mali is reported to be one of the largest recipients of U.S. aid in Africa.<ref name=cp>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Mali.pdf Mali country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (January 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref>\n\nMali is active in regional organizations such as the African Union (AU). Working to control and resolve regional conflicts, such as in Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, is one of Mali's major foreign policy goals. Mali feels threatened by the potential for the spillover of conflicts in neighboring states, and relations with those neighbors are often uneasy. General insecurity along borders in the north, including cross-border banditry and terrorism, remain troubling issues in regional regions.<ref name=cp/>\n\nAlthough [[Azawad]], a region spanning the expansive north of Mali, was proclaimed independent in April 2012 by [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] rebels, Mali has not recognised the [[proto-state|''de facto'' state]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/04/06/205763.html|publisher=Al Arabiya|title=Tuareg rebels declare the independence of Azawad, north of Mali|date=6 April 2012|access-date=6 April 2012}}</ref> Britain has closed its embassy; ECOWAS has declared an embargo against Mali, aiming to squeeze out Malian oil supplies; closed Mali's assets in the ECOWAS regional bank and has prepared a potential intervention force of 3,000 troops. France has declared it will assist in a potential intervention.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/mali-rebels-declare-independence-north-102935627.html |title=AU, US reject Mali rebels' independence declaration – Yahoo!

It also belongs to the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU); [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC); [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (NAM); an associate member of the [[European Community]] (EC); and [[African Development Bank]] (ADB).\n\nMali is active in regional organizations. It participates in the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and the West African Economic Monetary Union (UEMOA) for regional economic integration; [[Liptako–Gourma Authority]], which seeks to develop the contiguous areas of Mali, [[Niger]], and [[Burkina Faso]]; the [[Niger River Commission]]; the [[Permanent Interstate Committee for drought control in the Sahel]] (CILSS); and the Senegal River Valley Development Organization (OMVS).\n\nHistorically, Mali has used these organizations to leverage the promotion of regional peacekeeping efforts. One of the largest issues facing the country is security threats from extremist groups and consequential political unrest.\nOne of the most prominent examples of this is Mali's former membership the G5 Sahel with the fellow member states Burkina Faso (formerly), Chad, Mauritania, and Niger (formerly). The Sahel was originally formed on 16 February 2014, with the main objective of encouraging security and development. This partnership is historically significant due to the group's shared colonizer, France. In its first year of existence, the organization formed a legal framework for strategic intervention and a secretariat located in Nouakchott, Mauritania.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ecfr.eu/special/african-cooperation/g5-sahel/ | title=G5 Sahel | date=7 October 2020 }}</ref> The framework was titled the Development and Security Strategy (SDS). In 2017, the G5 Sahel Joint Force was created and funded through the Priority Investment Program (PIP), aiming to reduce violence and create more stability in the region. In a December 2018 coordination conference, $2.6 billion was pledged from foreign nations including the United States, European Union, Saudi Arabia, and China. American and French financial support is suspected to be, in part, a result of their consequentially lowered troop commitment in the region. This military collective targets organized crime and religious extremists specifically with cross-border operations. In addition to military-centered approaches, Mali and Niger have implemented Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration, or DDR, programs while Mauritania and Burkina Faso have not. DDR is an approach that removes weapons, breaks up crime organizations, and reintegrates combatants into civilian life or state-sanctioned armed forces. Although more costly and time-intensive, DDR has proven to be more sustainable than other stabilization approaches over time.<ref name=\"wilsoncenter.org\">{{cite web | url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/take-it-to-the-people-a-civil-military-roadmap-for-the-g5-sahel?gad=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqP2pBhDMARIsAJQ0CzoIPi6fyeIwUSkpwnMwGMlD5xHvRAONUo9eX1F8gRnMRcnfG5nM924aAgXREALw_wcB | title=Take It to the People: A Civil-Military Roadmap for the G5 Sahel }}</ref> The G5 Sahel has been weakening in the most recent years, with many forces from the European Union pulling their troops to concentrate their efforts on the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.africa-confidential.com/article-preview/id/13904/Disjointed_force | title=Disjointed force }}</ref> However, to compensate, the Sahel member states have reported on plans to expand the size of their force from six to fourteen battalions.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2023/05/g5-sahel-joint-force-briefing-and-consultations.php | title=G5 Sahel Joint Force: Briefing and Consultations : What's in Blue : Security Council Report }}</ref> Biannual reports from the Sahel have revealed that the efforts have become increasingly dire with high humanitarian needs and large terrorist activity with large resource and land occupation.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://dppa.un.org/en/asg-pobee-notwithstanding-support-extended-to-g5-sahel-stabilizing-region-hinges-aligning-our | title=ASG Pobee: \"Notwithstanding the support extended to the G5 Sahel, stabilizing the region hinges on aligning our policies and approaches, and on putting the Sahelian people at the forefront of our efforts.\" &#124; Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs }}</ref> This eventually lead to its withdrawal on 15 May 2022.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/05/1118582#:~:text=Mali%27s%20decision%20on%2015%20May,protracted%20political%20and%20security%20crises | title=Mali's withdrawal from G5 Sahel, Joint Force 'a setback' for the region &#124; UN News | date=19 May 2022 }}</ref>\n[[File:Malick Diaw and Vyacheslav Volodin (2023-03-19).jpg|thumb|Representatives of Mali and [[Russia]] at the 2nd International Parliamentary Conference \"Russia-Africa\" in Moscow, 19 March 2023]]\nAs seen with the G5-Sahel, Mali has not been a particularly active or compliant member of these organizations as a result of their ongoing political unrest. Despite some early successful peacekeeping initiatives by ECOWAS and the AU, their most recent joint policies are facing challenges of limited institutional capacity, low enforcement, and inexplicit language surrounding its implementation.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24758342 | jstor=24758342 | title=African Agency in R2P: Interventions by African Union and ECOWAS in Mali, Cote d'Ivoire, and Libya | last1=Aning | first1=Kwesi | last2=Edu-Afful | first2=Fiifi | journal=International Studies Review | date=23 December 2023 | volume=18 | issue=1 | pages=120–133 | doi=10.1093/isr/viv017 | url-access=subscription }}</ref> ECOWAS was originally founded to promote economic development across its 15 West African member states, but also works to promote political institutions and stability.

The most notable effort began with the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali ([[United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali|MINUSMA]]) in 2013. In 2022, Mali restricted United Nations peacekeeping operations through their security council<ref>{{cite news | url=https://allafrica.com/stories/202312120419.html | title=West Africa: UN Peacekeeping Mission Officially Ends in Mali | newspaper=Allafrica.com | date=12 December 2023 | last1=Chifamba | first1=Jerry }}</ref> and, in June 2023, asked for them to be removed. Although this program is being dissolved, some UN presence will remain in Mali. This effort kept about 15,000 soldiers and police personnel in Mali throughout the project's decade, but has recently been threatened by nearby territorial conflicts. It is also rumored that this removal may be the result of some strategic differences.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.africa-confidential.com/article-preview/id/14020/Mali_rejects_human_rights_mandate | title=Mali rejects human rights mandate }}</ref>  Since the AU's creation in 2002, there have been some difficulties aligning it with the UN. Generally, the AU prioritizes short-term solutions over long-term, which is opposite to the UN. This disagreement has contributed to arguments about jurisdiction and the correct approach to security efforts.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24538203 | jstor=24538203 |

This funding was meant to boost security efforts with the G5 Sahel, raising US$2.6 billion in pledges for the region from international donors.<ref name=\"wilsoncenter.org\" /> Since the dismantling of the Sahel, it is unclear if and how these funds have been distributed.
