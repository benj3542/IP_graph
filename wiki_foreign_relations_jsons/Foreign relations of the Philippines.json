This is evident in the Philippines' participation in the [[Iraq War]] and the [[War on Terror]]. Speaking to this support, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] praised the Philippines as a bastion of democracy in the East and called the Philippines America's oldest ally in [[Asia]]. President Bush's speech on October 18, 2003, was only the second U.S. presidential address to the Philippine Congress; U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] delivered the first.\n\nWith a robust relationship to the United States, the administration of former President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] sought to establish closer ties to its earlier colonizer, [[Spain]]. This was inspired by the attendance of [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos]] and [[Queen Sofía of Spain|Queen Sofía]] at the June 12, 1998 celebration honoring the centennial of the Philippines' independence from Spain. President Macapagal-Arroyo made two official visits to Spain during her presidency.\n[[File:Spanish Queen visit to Malacanang.jpg|thumb|278x278px|[[Benigno Aquino III|President Aquino]] with [[Queen Sofía of Spain]] in her visit to the Philippines ]]\nIn recent years, the Philippines attaches great importance in its relations with China, and has established significant cooperation with the country.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Senior Chinese legislator visits Philippines to boost ties – Xinhua {{!}} English.news.cn |work=www.xinhuanet.com |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-09/11/c_137460450.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911092206/http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-09/11/c_137460450.htm |archive-date=September 11, 2018 |access-date=September 11, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=September 5, 2018 |title=Warship incident shows Sino-Philippine relations have come a long way: China Daily |language=en |work=The Straits Times |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/warship-incident-shows-sino-philippine-relations-have-come-a-long-way-china-daily |access-date=September 11, 2018 |archive-date=September 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905145546/https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/warship-incident-shows-sino-philippine-relations-have-come-a-long-way-china-daily |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=2017 |title=China, ASEAN agree on framework for South China Sea code of conduct |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-china-philippines-idUSKCN18E1FS |access-date=September 11, 2018 |archive-date=May 18, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518123702/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-china-philippines-idUSKCN18E1FS |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=China, Philippines confirm twice-yearly bilateral consultation mechanism on South China Sea – Xinhua {{!}} English.news.cn |work=news.xinhuanet.com |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-05/19/c_136299206.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519180133/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-05/19/c_136299206.htm |archive-date=May 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Progress made on draft of South China Sea code of conduct |work=philstar.com |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/05/19/1701550/progress-made-draft-south-china-sea-code-conduct |access-date=September 11, 2018 |archive-date=May 19, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519065010/http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/05/19/1701550/progress-made-draft-south-china-sea-code-conduct |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Subscribe {{!}} theaustralian |work=www.theaustralian.com.au |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/xi-duterte-vow-closer-philippineschina-relations-faster-spending/news-story/a1c32f162010e5b2f8bed5acc85fbde2}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] has participated in various regional conflicts, including the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]].
