"{{Short description|none}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2025}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2025}}{{Politics of Sweden}}\nThe foreign policy of [[Sweden]] was formerly based on the premise that national security is best served by staying [[neutrality (international relations)|free of alliances]] in peacetime in order to remain a neutral country in the event of war, with this policy lasting from 1814 in the context of the [[French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars]] until the [[2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine]]. In 2002, Sweden revised its security doctrine. The security doctrine at that point still stated that \"Sweden pursues a policy of non-participation in military alliances,\" but permitted cooperation in response to threats against peace and security. The [[Government of Sweden|government]] also seeks to maintain Sweden's high [[standard of living]]. These two objectives required heavy expenditures for social welfare, defence spending at rates considered low by Western European standards (around 1.2% of GNP prior to 2022),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS|title=Military expenditure (% of GDP)|author=WorldBank|work=report|access-date=October 5, 2015}}</ref> and close attention to foreign trade opportunities and world economic cooperation. In 2024, Sweden formally became part of a military alliance for the first time since the end of the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] by [[Sweden–NATO relations|joining]] [[NATO]].\n\n==Foreign policy==\nThe foreign policy of Sweden encompasses a range of themes over the centuries. Some of the main issues include:<ref>Neil Kent, ''A Concise History of Sweden'' (2008),</ref><ref>Franklin D. Scott, ''Sweden: The Nation's History'' (1988)</ref><ref>Erik Thomson, \"Beyond the Military State: Sweden’s Great Power Period in Recent Historiography.\" ''History Compass'' 9.4 (2011): 269-283.

This neutrality allowed Sweden to navigate the tumultuous European political landscape and maintain its sovereignty. It dropped the neutrality policy in 2022–2024 in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and joined NATO on 7 March 2024.\n* Sweden has sought to maintain a balance of power in Northern Europe, acting as a counterweight to dominant regional powers. This approach aimed to prevent any single power from gaining excessive influence and threatening Swedish interests.\n* Sweden's historical dominance in the Baltic Sea region played a crucial role in shaping its diplomatic history. Through territorial expansion, Sweden established control over strategic territories, such as present-day Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and parts of Russia, impacting its relations with neighboring states.\n* During the 17th and 18th centuries, Sweden emerged as a major European power, participating in conflicts such as the Thirty Years' War and the Great Northern War. Its diplomatic efforts were often influenced by power struggles with other European great powers, such as Russia and Poland.\n* Sweden has actively engaged in peace mediation efforts, seeking to resolve conflicts and broker peace agreements. Notable examples include the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War, and various mediation efforts during the 20th century.\n* Sweden has a longstanding tradition of promoting international cooperation, human rights, and humanitarian initiatives. It has been involved in the establishment of international organizations such as the League of Nations and the United Nations, and has championed causes such as humanitarian aid and disarmament.\n* Sweden has pursued close ties and cooperation with its neighboring Nordic countries, particularly Denmark, Finland, Iceland, and Norway. This commitment to Scandinavian unity has been reflected in diplomatic initiatives, trade agreements, and cultural exchanges.\n* Sweden's relationship with the European Union (EU) has been a significant theme in its recent diplomatic history. While Sweden joined the EU in 1995, it has maintained a somewhat reserved approach, often balancing its national interests with EU membership.\n* Sweden has been an advocate for global development and has provided substantial aid to developing countries. It has sought to address global inequalities and promote sustainable development through its aid programs, often challenging neocolonial practices.\n* In the 21st century, Sweden has gained attention for its feminist foreign policy approach, which aims to integrate gender equality into its diplomatic efforts. Sweden has been a leading advocate for women's rights globally, emphasizing the inclusion and empowerment of women in peacebuilding, conflict resolution, and development processes.\n\n==United Nations==\n{{Main|Sweden and the United Nations}}\nSweden has been a [[Member states of the United Nations|member]] of the United Nations since November 19, 1946, and participates actively in the activities of the organization, including as an [[List of members of the United Nations Security Council|elected member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] (1957–1958, 1975–1976, 1997–1998 and 2017–2018), providing [[Dag Hammarskjöld]] as the second elected [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General of the UN]], etc. The strong interest of the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish Government]] and people in international cooperation and peacemaking has been supplemented in the early 1980s by renewed attention to [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] and European security questions.\n\nSweden decided not to sign the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Sweden declines to sign UN nuclear ban treaty |url=https://www.thelocal.se/20190712/sweden-declines-to-sign-un-nuclear-treaty |work=The Local |date=12 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==European Union==\n[[File:EU15-1995 European Union map enlargement.svg|thumb|right|{{legend|#003399|EU members in 1995}}{{legend|#ffcc00|Sweden, Austria and Finland}}]]\nAfter the then Prime Minister [[Ingvar Carlsson]] had submitted Sweden's application in July 1991 the negotiations began in February 1993. Finally, on January 1, 1995, Sweden became a member of the [[European Union]]. While some argued that it went against Sweden's historic policy of neutrality, where Sweden had not joined during the [[Cold War]] because it was seen as incompatible with neutrality, others viewed the move as a natural extension of the economic cooperation that had been going on since 1972 with the EU.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Sweden addressed this controversy by reserving the right not to participate in any future EU defence alliance. In membership negotiations in 1993–1994, Sweden also had reserved the right to make the final decision on whether to join the third stage of the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|EMU]] \"in light of continued developments.\" In a nationwide referendum in November 1994, 52.3 percent of participants voted in favour of EU membership. Voter turnout was high, 83.3 percent of the eligible voters voted. The main Swedish concerns included winning popular support for EU cooperation, EU enlargement, and strengthening the EU in areas such as economic growth, job promotion, and environmental issues.\n\nIn polls taken a few years after the referendum, many Swedes indicated that they were unhappy with Sweden's membership in the EU. However, after Sweden successfully hosted its first presidency of the EU in the first half of 2001, most Swedes today have a more positive attitude towards the EU. The government, with the support of the [[Centerpartiet|Center Party]], decided in spring 1997 to remain outside of the EMU, at least until 2002. A referendum was held on September 14, 2003. The results were 55.9% for ''no'', 42.0% ''yes'' and 2.1% giving no answer (\"blank vote\").\n\n==Nordic Council==\nSwedish foreign policy has been the result of a wide consensus. Sweden cooperates closely with its Nordic neighbors, formally in economic and social matters through the [[Nordic Council|Nordic Council of Ministers]] and informally in political matters through direct consultation.\n\n==Nonalignment==\n{{main|Sweden–NATO relations|Swedish neutrality}}\n[[File:Swedish PM Stefan Löfven meeting Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei 01.jpg|thumb|Swedish Prime Minister [[Stefan Löfven]] with Iranian Supreme Leader [[Ali Khamenei]], February 11, 2017]]\n[[Swedish neutrality]] and nonalignment policy in peacetime may partly explain how the country could stay out of wars since 1814. Swedish governments have not defined nonalignment as precluding outspoken positions in international affairs. Government leaders have favored national liberation movements that enjoy broad support among developing world countries, with notable attention to Africa. During the [[Cold War]], Sweden was suspicious of the superpowers, which it saw as making decisions affecting small countries without always consulting those countries. With the end of the Cold War, that suspicion has lessened somewhat, although Sweden still chooses to remain nonaligned. Sweden has devoted particular attention to issues of disarmament, arms control, and nuclear nonproliferation and has contributed importantly to UN and other international peacekeeping efforts, including the NATO-led peacekeeping forces in the Balkans. It sat as an observer in the [[Western European Union]] from 1995 to 2011, but it is not an active member of [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]] and the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]].\n\nSweden's engagement with NATO was especially strengthened during the term of [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/review//2013/Partnerships-NATO-2013/Sweden-partnerships/EN/index.htm|title=Sweden: a special NATO partner?|author=NATO Review|work=NATO Review|access-date=February 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nSweden's nonalignment policy has led it to serve as the [[protecting power]] for a number of nations who don't have formal diplomatic relations with each other for various reasons.  It currently represents the United States, Canada, and several Western European nations in North Korea for consular matters.  On several occasions when the United Kingdom broke off relations with Iran (including the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]], the [[The Satanic Verses controversy|Salman Rushdie affair]], and the 2011 storming of the British embassy in Tehran), Sweden served as the protecting power for the UK.\n\nIn May 2022, Sweden formally applied to join the [[NATO]] alliance. The public opinion in the Nordic region had changed in favour of joining NATO since [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24 of the same year.]]<ref>{{cite news |last1=Emmott |first1=Robin |last2=Devranoglu |first2=Nevzat |title=Finland, Sweden apply to join NATO amid Turkish objections |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/finland-sweden-submit-application-join-nato-2022-05-18/ |work=Reuters |date=18 May 2022 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman [[Maria Zakharova]] said in March 2022 that her government would have to respond if Sweden became a NATO member.<ref name=\"eatrs\">{{cite news |date=25 February 2022 |title=Russia Sends Bone-Chilling Message To Sweden & Finland; Threatens 'Military Implications' If They Go The Ukraine Way |publisher=The EurAsian Times |url=https://eurasiantimes.com/russia-sends-bone-chilling-message-to-sweden-threatens-with-military-implications-if-they-go-the-ukraine-way/}}</ref> However, in June 2022 President [[Vladimir Putin]] contradicted the statement, claiming that Sweden and Finland can \"join whatever they want\" on the condition that there will be no NATO military deployment in either country.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-06-29 |title=Putin issues fresh warning to Finland and Sweden on installing Nato infrastructure |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/29/russia-condemns-nato-invitation-finland-sweden |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=The Guardian |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2024, Sweden officially ended this period of nonalignment when it joined NATO.<ref>{{Cite web |last=NATO |title=Sweden officially joins NATO |url=https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_223446.htm |access-date=2025-07-01 |website=NATO |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Military ==\nSweden has employed its military on numerous occasions since the end of the Cold War, from Bosnia and Congo to Afghanistan and Libya. According to one study, \"this military activism is driven both by the Swedish internationalist tradition of \"doing good\" in the world, but also for instrumental purposes. These include a desire for political influence in international institutions, an interest in collective milieu shaping, and a concern to improve the interoperability and effectiveness of the Swedish military.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |journal=The Oxford Handbook of Swedish Politics the Oxford Handbook of Swedish Politics |last1=Aggestam |first1=Lisbeth |last2=Hyde-Price |first2=Adrian |editor1-first=Jon |editor1-last=Pierre |date=December 17, 2015 |title=A Force for Good? |url=https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/34477/chapter-abstract/292540430|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199665679.001.0001 |isbn=9780199665679 |access-date=2024-01-29|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n==Participation in international organizations==\n{{div-col|colwidth=15em}}\n*[[African Development Bank|AfDB]]\n*[[Amnesty International]]\n*[[Asian Development Bank|AsDB]]\n*[[Australia Group]]\n*[[Bank for International Settlements|BIS]]\n*[[Council of the Baltic Sea States|CBSS]]\n*[[CERN]]\n*[[Council of Europe]]\n*[[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council|EAPC]]\n*[[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|EBRD]]\n*[[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|ECE]]\n*[[European Investment Bank|EIB]]\n*[[European Space Agency|ESA]]\n*[[European Union|EU]]\n*[[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]]\n*[[Group of 9|G-9]]\n*[[Group of Ten (economics)|G-10]]\n*[[Inter-American Development Bank|IADB]]\n*[[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]]\n*[[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|IBRD]]\n*[[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]]\n*[[International Chamber of Commerce|ICC]]\n*[[International Criminal Court|ICCt]]\n*[[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|ICRM]]\n*[[International Development Association|IDA]]\n*[[International Energy Agency|IEA]]\n*[[International Fund for Agricultural Development|IFAD]]\n*[[International Finance Corporation|IFC]]\n*[[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|IFRCS]]\n*[[International Hydrographic Organization|IHO]]\n*[[International Labour Organization|ILO]]\n*[[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]\n*[[International Maritime Organization|IMO]]\n*[[International Mobile Satellite Organization|Inmarsat]]\n*[[Intelsat]]\n*[[Interpol]]\n*[[International Olympic Committee|IOC]]\n*[[International Organization for Migration|IOM]]\n*[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]\n*[[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]]\n*[[International Trade Union Confederation|ITUC]]\n*[[United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara|MINURSO]]\n*[[New Agenda Coalition|NAC]]\n*[[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]]\n*[[Nuclear Energy Agency|NEA]]\n*[[Nordic Investment Bank|NIB]]\n*[[Nordic Council]]\n*[[Nuclear Suppliers Group|NSG]]\n*[[OECD]]\n*[[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons|OPCW]]\n*[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]]\n*[[Permanent Court of Arbitration|PCA]]\n*[[Partnership for Peace|PFP]]\n*[[Southeast Europe Transport Community|Transport Community]]\n* [[Sweden and the United Nations|UN]]\n*[[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UNCTAD]]\n*[[United Nations Environment Programme|UNEP]]\n*[[UNESCO]]\n*[[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]]\n*[[United Nations Human Rights Council|UNHRC]]\n*[[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UNIDO]]\n*[[United Nations Iraq–Kuwait Observation Mission|UNIKOM]]\n*[[United Nations Institute for Training and Research|UNITAR]]\n*[[United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea|UNMEE]]\n*[[United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina|UNMIBH]]\n*[[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]]\n*[[UN mediation of the Kashmir dispute#United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan|UNMOGIP]]\n*[[United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka|UNMOP]]\n*[[United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia|UNOMIG]]\n*[[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor|UNTAET]]\n*[[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization|UNTSO]]\n*[[Universal Postal Union|UPU]]\n*[[World Customs Organization|WCO]]\n*[[Western European Union|WEU]] (observer)\n*[[World Food Programme|WFP]]\n*[[World Federation of Trade Unions|WFTU]]\n*[[World Health Organization|WHO]]\n*[[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]]\n*[[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]]\n*[[World Trade Organization|WTrO]]\n*[[Zangger Committee]]\n{{div-col-end}}\n\n===Multilateral===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:100%;
