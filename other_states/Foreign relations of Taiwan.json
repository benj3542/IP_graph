Since taking office, Lai has pursued an expansion of Taiwan's strategic global partnerships, particularly with nations involved in the Indo-Pacific strategy, to counter China's regional influence.

As Taiwan continues to assert its sovereignty and democratic values, the international community's response will be pivotal in shaping the political and economic future of the region.\n\n===Development assistance===\nSince 1950 Taiwan has given high priority to international aid, making its representatives welcome even in states without formal diplomatic relations. The policies provide generous aid without strict accountability conditions, especially in developing nations in Africa, Latin America, and the South Pacific. Building a reputation as a responsible and generous donor has earned it prestige, especially in contrast to the role of foreign aid in China's policies, such as the [[Belt and Road Initiative]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Atkinson|first=Joel|date=2014-05-27|title=Aid in Taiwan's foreign policy: putting Ma Ying-jeou's aid reforms in historical perspective|journal=The Pacific Review|language=en|volume=27|issue=3|pages=409–431|doi=10.1080/09512748.2014.909524|s2cid=153611281|issn=0951-2748}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Atkinson|first=Joel|date=May 2018|title=The real East Asian Aid model: Development assistance as an instrument of comprehensive security in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan|journal=Development Policy Review|language=en|volume=36|issue=3|pages=265–284|doi=10.1111/dpr.12283|s2cid=157964933}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Tubilewicz|first1=Czeslaw|last2=Guilloux|first2=Alain|date=June 2011|title=Does size matter?

By the 1990s, Taiwan had a democratic system with multiparty competition, factionalism, a vigorous civil society, and many interest groups.

Think tanks have played a major role in planning and operationalizing relations with countries around the world.<ref>Pascal Abb and Alan Hao Yang,  \"The impact of democratization, political culture, and diplomatic isolation on think-tank development in Taiwan.\" ''[[Pacific Affairs]]'', [[University of British Columbia]]. 91.1 (2018): 73–94.</ref>\n\nEuropean universities, research centers, and think tanks have developed a new academic field of Taiwan studies, especially in Europe, because of the unique status of Taiwan in the world's diplomatic system.

This number includes 59&nbsp;[[sovereign state]]s, 3&nbsp;[[Dependent territory|dependent or quasi-dependent territories]], and the [[European Union]].\n\nUnofficial diplomatic relations typically involve an \"Economic, Trade and Cultural Office\" in Taiwan for the partner country, as well as a corresponding \"Taipei/Taiwan/ROC Representative Office\" representing Taiwan within the partner country. These unofficial offices generally function as embassies despite not being officially named as such. For example, the [[American Institute in Taiwan]] functions as the United States' [[de facto embassy|''de facto'' embassy]], with the chairman and staff acting as unofficial government consulate officers who nevertheless perform duties that official embassies would undertake.\n\nVarious countries host Taiwanese representative offices within themselves but don't have representative offices in Taiwan. One country, [[Luxembourg]], has a representative office in Taiwan but does not host a Taiwanese representative office within itself; Taiwan's interests in Luxembourg are served by the [[Taipei Representative Office in Brussels|Taipei Representative Office in the EU and Belgium]]. Taiwan also regards the [[European Union]], with which it also has unofficial relations via the Taipei Representative Office in the EU and Belgium, as a state entity in the context of international relations; the EU is a [[supranational union]] with a high level of integration between its member states, though each member state retains its national sovereignty.\n\nTaiwan has unofficial diplomatic relations with [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau|Macao]], both of which are [[special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions of the PRC]], though Taiwan does not have such relations with [[Mainland China]] (the PRC). Technically, Hong Kong and Macau are integral territories of the PRC, governed under the \"[[One country, two systems|One Country, Two Systems]]\" framework. This means that Taiwan effectively has unofficial relations with parts of the PRC but not with the national government of the PRC itself. Taiwan maintains hostile relations with the PRC through the [[Mainland Affairs Council]], whose counterpart is the [[Taiwan Affairs Office]]; neither office is considered to be an embassy by either Taiwan or the PRC, and both offices are operated within the home country rather than within the host country.\n\nTaiwan has strong unofficial relations with [[Somaliland]], which is a [[list of states with limited recognition|self-declared state]] in the [[Horn of Africa]] that is claimed as the territory of neighbouring [[Somalia]], in a state of affairs that displays strong parallels to Taiwan's own sovereignty dispute with China.\n\nTaiwan maintains a \"Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office\" in [[Guam]], which is an [[Insular area#Unincorporated organized territories|unincorporated organized territory]] of the [[United States]] located in [[Oceania]].\n\nIn 2021, [[Lithuania]] announced that it would open an unofficial representative office in Taiwan, and Taiwan likewise announced that it would open an unofficial representative office in Lithuania. The Lithuania office was due to open by fall (autumn) of 2021 in the Northern Hemisphere, which is essentially September to November inclusive.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Tai|first1=Ya-chen|last2=Mazzetta|first2=Matthew|date=July 20, 2021|title=Lithuania to open trade office in Taiwan this fall|work=Focus Taiwan|url=https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202107200030|access-date=November 14, 2021|archive-date=14 November 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221114125338/https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202107200030|url-status=live}}</ref> [[China–Lithuania relations|Relations between Lithuania and the PRC]] have simultaneously soured.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Galbraith|first=Andrew|date=October 30, 2021|title=China warns Lithuania, European officials over Taiwan row|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/world/china-warns-lithuania-european-officials-over-taiwan-row-2021-10-30/|access-date=November 14, 2021|archive-date=14 November 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221114125336/https://www.reuters.com/world/china-warns-lithuania-european-officials-over-taiwan-row-2021-10-30/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA certain number of countries have indirect unofficial diplomatic relations with Taiwan via third-party proxy countries.

After Japan's defeat in 1945, Taiwan was placed under the temporary administration of the ROC to handle the surrender of Japanese administration. The [[Chinese Civil War]] broke out again between the Nationalists and the CCP. The CCP gained control of the [[mainland China|mainland]] in 1949 and proclaimed the People's Republic of China (PRC), while the Nationalists fled to Taiwan, taking the ROC government with them.

The constitutional position of Taipei is that the territory of the ROC is divided into the \"Mainland Area\" and the \"[[free area of the republic of china|Free Area]]\" (also known as \"Taiwan Area\"). Administratively, cross-strait relations are not conducted by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Republic of China)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] of Taiwan, but by the [[Mainland Affairs Council]], an instrument of the [[Executive Yuan]]. The relations with Hong Kong and [[Macau]] are also conducted by the Mainland Affairs Council, although not all regulations applicable to mainland China automatically apply to those territories.\n\nTaiwanese and Chinese governments do not directly interact. Talks are conducted by China's [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits]] (ARATS) and Taiwan's [[Straits Exchange Foundation]] (SEF), privately constituted bodies that are controlled and directly answerable to the executive branches of their respective governments.\n\nUntil the late 1990s, Hong Kong and Macau were [[British Hong Kong|British]] and [[Portuguese Macau|Portuguese]] colonies respectively. They provided neutral detour points for people and goods crossing the strait. They and Singapore served as venues for talks between the two sides at that time.

Panamanians studying in Taiwan were given the choice of returning to Panama within 30 days or continuing their studies in China. Panama was motivated by promises of multibillion-dollar investments. The shift of recognition began with a letter sent in 2015 to the Chinese government that, according to [[Isabel Saint Malo]], Panama's vice president, was titled \"Panama wants to make ties with China\". The contents of the letter have been kept confidential, as well as the reasons why it was sent. It has also been kept confidential who delivered the letter and assisted in the switchover process, a person described only as \"a distinguished member of the Chinese community living in Panama\".\n\nThe US ambassador to Panama, [[John D. Feeley]], said that he had asked [[List of heads of state of Panama|Panamanian President]] [[Juan Carlos Varela]] about the switchover in 2016 but Varela lied to him, saying that there were no plans to make the switchover. Feeley also said that Varela didn't tell him the truth until one hour before the nationwide announcement.\n\nOthers questioned why the Panamanian government continues to use equipment donated by Taiwan. The Panamanian government initially gave no reason, later saying that one reason was because \"China is the second largest user of the Panama Canal\" and President Varela said it was because he \"couldn't accept it anymore\" and \"that's what every responsible leader would do\". The Panamanian government officially said that Taiwan was an inalienable part of China and that the switchover was to comply with the one-China policy. The ROC government said that Panama was its \"number one ally\" and that it would not participate in Beijing's checkbook diplomacy. The Taiwanese government complained that Panama maliciously hid the switchover process until the last moment.\n\nA Panamanian government agency later said that the switchover was because of Taiwanese president [[Tsai Ing-wen]]'s violations and lack of regard to the 1992 consensus regarding China, Taiwan and the One-china policy. Panamanian newspaper La Estrella questioned the reasons Varela initially gave for the switchover, like \"China has the world's largest population and the 2nd largest economy and user of the Panama Canal\"; La Estrella called Varela's actions contradictory and said that the reasons Varela gave were the reality Panama has lived under for decades, so those couldn't be regarded as valid reasons for the switchover. The same newspaper also says that China's plans in Latin America convince Latin American nations easily, with apparent benefits in the short term but with dependency on China in the long term and that China is silently invading other countries and Latin America in general.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=GESE – La Estrella de Panamá|title=Panamá, ¿una franquicia china?|url=https://www.laestrella.com.pa/internacional/america/180718/china-panama-franquicia|website=La Estrella de Panamá|access-date=19 December 2019|archive-date=19 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219224140/https://www.laestrella.com.pa/internacional/america/180718/china-panama-franquicia|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Panamá espera jugosas inversiones de China|url=http://elsiglo.com.pa/panama/panama-espera-jugosas-inversiones-china/24016355|website=El Siglo|access-date=24 August 2018|archive-date=24 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824034402/http://elsiglo.com.pa/panama/panama-espera-jugosas-inversiones-china/24016355|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=China, una agenda ambiciosa|url=https://m.prensa.com/opinion/China-agenda-ambiciosa_0_4812268806.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824034511/https://m.prensa.com/opinion/China-agenda-ambiciosa_0_4812268806.html|archive-date=24 August 2018|access-date=24 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the first year of diplomatic relations, 19 treaties were signed, including a Free Trade Treaty. Varela said that its main purpose was to allow Chinese nationals to easily invest in Panama. Controversies over the sudden switchover included lack of due process, unusually high levels of confidentiality, and the fact that a few weeks before the switchover, Taiwan had donated medical equipment to Panama. In 2018, the first flight from Beijing to Panama by Air China landed at [[Tocumen International Airport]], with a technical stop in Houston. Varela called it a milestone in Panamanian aviation. Due to this new route, the Panamanian ministry of tourism expected at least 40,000 Chinese tourist visits per year. \"History and socioeconomic reality\" were later cited as reasons for the switchover. Varela said that the move was backed by diplomatic relationships dating from 1912 and that the move strengthened the existing relationships, despite the fact that those relationships were with the ROC, not the PRC. As a result, Panama City was almost immediately added to China's list of officially approved tourist destinations.<ref>{{cite web|date=5 April 2018|title=Aterriza el primer vuelo de Air China en Panamá &#124; La Prensa Panamá|url=https://www.prensa.com/economia/Aterriza-primer-Air-China-Panama_0_5001249854.html|website=www.prensa.com|access-date=29 January 2020|archive-date=29 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200129131357/https://www.prensa.com/economia/Aterriza-primer-Air-China-Panama_0_5001249854.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=GESE-La Estrella de Panamá|title=Air China inaugura vuelo Beijing-Houston-Panamá|url=https://www.laestrella.com.pa/nacional/180323/air-china-vuelo-beijing-inaugura|website=La Estrella de Panamá|access-date=19 December 2019|archive-date=19 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219224139/https://www.laestrella.com.pa/nacional/180323/air-china-vuelo-beijing-inaugura|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Panama cuts ties with Taiwan in favour of China|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40256499|access-date=13 June 2017|archive-date=19 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619035643/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40256499|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=17 February 2018|title=Conoce la posible ruta y estaciones del tren Panamá-Chiriquí|url=https://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Conoce-posible-ruta-estaciones-Panama-Chiriqui_0_4966003387.html|website=TVN|access-date=24 June 2018|archive-date=25 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625021614/https://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Conoce-posible-ruta-estaciones-Panama-Chiriqui_0_4966003387.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The CCP government has offered the [[Panameñista Party]]-led government a free feasibility study for the planned 4th set of locks in the Panama Canal to gain a competitive advantage in bids for choosing the company to build the 4th set of locks, not to mention plans for a 1,200 hectare industrial park on the Pacific coast and a 4-hectare campus in Amador near the Biomuseo to house the PRC embassy in Panama.

However, in 1995 CAL dropped the [[national colours]] from its [[Aircraft livery|livery]], and now flies to international destinations under its own name. Many countries' national airlines similarly set up special subsidiaries, known as \"shadow airlines\", to operate services to Taipei, with a different name, and livery omitting national symbols. [[British Airways]]' subsidiary, [[British Asia Airways]], operated flights to London, [[KLM]]'s subsidiary, [[KLM Asia]], operated flights to [[Amsterdam]], and [[Swissair]]'s subsidiary, [[Swissair Asia]], operated flights to [[Zürich]], [[Air France Asie]] operated flights to Paris, [[Japan Air Lines]] established a subsidiary called [[Japan Asia Airways]] to operate flights to Tokyo, while [[Qantas]] had a subsidiary called [[Australia Asia Airlines]], which operated flights to Sydney. These subsidiaries ceased operations when their parent companies were privatized or went bankrupt (in Swissair's case), with KLM Asia being the only remaining active shadow subsidiary. Other countries' flag carriers, such as Germany's [[Lufthansa]], operated flights to Taipei using an existing subsidiary (in Lufthansa's case, [[Condor Airlines|Condor]]).\n\nBefore the completion of the second runway at New Tokyo International Airport (now [[Narita International Airport]]) in Chiba, Japan, airlines from Taiwan were required to utilize [[Haneda Airport|Haneda International Airport]] for their Tokyo routes in order not to offend the airlines from the PRC that flew to Narita.
