"{{short description|none}}\n{{Promotional|date=October 2022}}\n{{Politics of Abkhazia}}The Republic of [[Abkhazia]] is a [[List of states with limited recognition|partially recognized state]] in the [[South Caucasus]] which declared independence from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] during the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)]]. At the time, the [[Soviet Union]] had recently [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapsed]] (1991).\n\nSince 1992, Abkhazia has sought [[Diplomatic recognition|recognition]] as a [[sovereign state]] from the international community. Abkhazia is still [[International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia|considered]] by most countries to be part of Georgia. Abkhazia maintains relations with five [[Member states of the United Nations|United Nations (UN) member states]] and two other partially recognized states.\n\n== Relations with sovereign states and partially recognized states ==\n[[File:Abkhazia relations.png|thumb|260px|Foreign relations of Abkhazia {{legend|#008000|diplomatic relations and recognition}} {{legend|#00FF00|diplomatic recognition only}}]]\nAbkhazia was central to the [[Russo-Georgian War]] alongside South Ossetia. Shortly after the war on 26 August 2008, Russia recognized the independence of Abkhazia, the first UN member state to do so.<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 28, 2008 |title=Security Council Briefed by Political Affairs, Peacekeeping on Georgia Developments, Including 26 August Recognition Decrees on Abkhazia, South Ossetia |url=https://press.un.org/en/2008/sc9438.doc.htm |website=United Nations}}</ref>\n\nSince then, Abkhazia has obtained and retains recognition from four other UN member states: [[Nicaragua]] (5 September 2008), [[Venezuela]] (10 September 2009), [[Nauru]] (15 December 2009), and [[Syria]] (31 May 2018). [[Transnistria]] – which is claimed by Moldova, recognized Abkhazia on 22 January 1993. Abkhazia arranged mutual recognitions with [[South Ossetia]] on 20 September 2005, territory also claimed by Georgia.\n\nAbkhazia has also obtained recognition from states that have since revoked this. These include [[Vanuatu]] (2011–2013) and [[Tuvalu]] (2011–2014). Abkhazia maintains unofficial contacts in several other countries, including [[Belarus]] (2008, 2009, 2020), [[Italy]] (2011), [[San Marino]] (2011), [[Eritrea]] (2014), [[North Korea]] (2017, 2018), [[Iran]] (2021), [[Yemen]] (2021) and [[Northern Cyprus]] (2008) (claimed by Cyprus).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| State\n! style=\"width:6%;\"| Date of diplomatic recognition\n! style=\"width:6%;\"| [[Diplomatic relations]] established \n!Notes\n|--valign=\"top\"\n\n| {{flag|Nauru}}||<!-- date relations started--> 15 December 2009 \n|29 September 2016 \n|{{main|Abkhazia–Nauru relations}}On December 15, 2009, Nauru became the fourth UN member state to recognize Abkhazia.
