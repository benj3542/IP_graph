After it was occupied by [[Turkey]], Northern Cyprus' relations with the rest of the world were further complicated by a series of [[United Nations]] resolutions which declared its independence [[de jure|legally]] invalid. A [[Cypriot Annan Plan referendum, 2004|2004 UN Referendum]] on settling the [[Cyprus dispute]] was [[Cypriot Annan Plan referendum, 2004#Reasons for approval by Turkish Cypriots|accepted]] by the [[Turkish Cypriots]] but [[Cypriot Annan Plan referendum, 2004#Specific reasons for rejection by the Greek Cypriots|rejected]] by the [[Greek Cypriots]]. After that, the [[European Union]] [[Northern Cyprus and the European Union#Trade|declared its intentions]] to assist in reducing the economic isolation of Northern Cyprus and began giving aid to the territory. However, due to pressure from [[Greece]] and the [[Republic of Cyprus]], this aid coming from EU funds cannot be used on Greek Cypriot land and property nor on public bodies. As a result, [[Northern Cyprus and the European Union#Aid programme|these funds]] can be used only on 29% of people on the island of Cyprus (those under the ''[[de facto]]'' control of Northern Cyprus).<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/36718092 |author=Nathalie Tocci |author-link=Nathalie Tocci |title=The Cyprus Stalemate: What next?|journal=International Crisis Group Europe Report, No. 171 |date=January 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThere is an [[embargo against Northern Cyprus|embargo against the entity]] in many areas, decisively affecting its attempts at international contacts and representation.<ref name=guncavdi>{{cite journal|last1=Günçavdi|first1=Ömer|last2=Küçük|first2=Suat|title=Economic Growth Under Embargoes in North Cyprus: An Input-Output Analysis|journal=Turkish Studies|date=2009|volume=10|issue=3|pages=365&ndash;392|doi=10.1080/14683840903141699|s2cid=30848722|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/9621/1/MPRA_paper_9621.pdf}}</ref><ref name=talmon>{{cite journal|last1=Talmon|first1=Stefan|title=The Cyprus Question before the European Court of Justice|journal=European Journal of International Law|date=2001|volume=12|issue=4|pages=727&ndash;750|doi=10.1093/ejil/12.4.727|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The thorn in Europe's side|url=https://www.economist.com/news/2002/01/16/the-thorn-in-europes-side|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=25 July 2015|date=2002-01-16}}</ref>\n\n==International recognition==\n\nTurkey is the only country which recognises Northern Cyprus.\n\nRumors that [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]] briefly recognized Northern Cyprus right after its [[Declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|declaration of independence]] have persisted.<ref name=\"Bangladesh\">{{Cite journal|title=Great Powers, Counter Secession, and Non-Recognition: Britain and the 1983 Unilateral Declaration of Independence of the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus”|author=James Ker-Lindsay|journal=Diplomacy & Statecraft|volume=28|issue=3|pages=431-453|DOI=10.1080/09592296.2017.1347445}}</ref> At the time, Bangladesh denied that it recognized Northern Cyprus.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Ren Wenhui|title=Cyprus: Storm over Turkish Cypriot state|date=12 December 1983|page=17|quote= So far, besides Turkey, only Bangladesh has reportedly recognized the newly declared state, but in Dacca officials denied the report.|publisher=[[Beijing Review]]|issue=50}}</ref> However, a 2017 study of British [[diplomatic cable]]s concluded that though Pakistan never recognized Northern Cyprus, Bangladesh seemingly extended recognition in 1983 \"but quickly regretted the decision and so decided to pretend that it had not.\"<ref name=\"Bangladesh\"/>  Pakistan and Bangladesh were reportedly persuaded to withhold recognition under the threat that they would risk losing [[United States foreign aid|US foreign aid]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Zaim M.

As part of this bid, Turkey signed a protocol extending its [[customs union]] to the new EU members, including the Republic of Cyprus, which Turkey does not recognise.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Turkey made sure this was not tantamount to recognition with the inclusion of a declaration, stipulating their continued policy of non-recognition of what they describe as the \"Greek Cypriot administration of Southern Cyprus\" until a settlement is reached.  This declaration is not accepted by the EU which did not accept this statement as forming part of the acquis and expects Turkey to fully abide to its obligations against the Republic of Cyprus. The TRNC views any move by the EU to force Turkish recognition of the Republic of Cyprus as an effort to cut them off from their base of support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bic-rhr.com/research/cyprus-gas-dispute-turkish-obstinance-and-european-passivity|title = Cyprus Gas Dispute: Turkish Obstinance and European Passivity &#124; BIC-RHR}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 September 2011, [[Turkey]] and [[Northern Cyprus]] signed the EEZ border agreement in New York.<ref>[http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2012/07/20120712-3.htm Official Gazette] 12 July 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2012/10/20121010-3-1.pdf Official Gazette] EEZ Border (Page 4)</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\nThe UK maintains a dialogue with the Turkish Cypriot community, although still does not recognize [[Northern Cyprus]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/format.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWFC/HCJ/2020/37.html&query=(%22Northern+Cyprus%22)|title=Local Authority B vs. X (mother) and V (father) and T (by his Children's Guardian)|newspaper=England and Wales Family Court Decisions (High Court Judges)|date=6 May 2020|location=London}}Paragraph 10.</ref>\n\nOn 3 February 2017, The [[United Kingdom]]'s High Court stated \"There was no duty in the [[United Kingdom]] law upon the Government to refrain from recognizing [[Northern Cyprus]].
