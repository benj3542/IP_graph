The KGB's aim was suspected to be using these movements to restrain and hamper Moldovan desire for independence.<ref>Odom and Dujarric, \"Commonwealth or Empire?, Hudson, 1995, 35.</ref> Although [[Ukraine]]'s historical claim to Transnistria was equally as strong, Soviet/Russian military leaders in Transnistria (including those of the [[14th Guards Combined Arms Army]]) tried to claim that the region was \"part of Russia,\" despite the hundreds of miles of Ukraine which separated Transnistria from Russia.\n\nFollowing the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russia repeatedly acted in ways that denied the former Soviet republics, including [[Moldova]], their sovereignty and right to exist. Transnistria broke away from [[Moldova]] with the assistance of the 14th Guards Army following a brief but intense war in 1992. Supporting the Transnistrian separatists formed part of this imperial agenda. Transnistria, which declared independence from Moldova in 1990 but has not been recognized by the United Nations, has been heavily reliant on Russian support for its survival and de facto independence.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Institute for the Study of War |url=http://dev-isw.bivings.com/ |access-date=2024-02-29 |website=Institute for the Study of War |language=en |archive-date=25 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220325065358/https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-march-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Russia has continued to provide strong political support, recognizing its government and offering diplomatic backing in international forums. This support has been critical in sustaining Transnistria's [[de facto]] independence from [[Moldova]].\n\nSince then, it has maintained a close relationship with Russia, which has included economic aid, political support, and the presence of Russian military forces in the territory.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Chernova |first=Christian Edwards, Radina Gigova, Anna |date=2024-02-28 |title=Transnistria is asking Russia for protection.

Throughout 2022–2023, Russia reportedly increased its economic aid to Transnistria, helping to stabilize the breakaway region's economy amid global economic challenges. This aid has included direct financial support, subsidies for natural gas, and other economic benefits.\n\n==Diplomatic relations==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width:74%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:175px;\"| Entity !!
